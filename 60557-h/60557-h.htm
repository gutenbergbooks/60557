<p>The manuscript relating to this parish is lost.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>Lanwhitton, vulgo Lawhitton, is in the hundred of East;
and hath to the west South Pederwin, to the north Launceston,
to the east the river Tamar, to the south Lezant.</p>

<p>As for the name, I take Whitton to be the same as
Whidden, white or fair; so as to signify the white or fair
church, from the beauty of its first building. It is a
rectory valued in the King’s books at 19<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>
6<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span>
8<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> The
Bishop of Exeter is the patron.</p>

<p>All this parish doth in a manner entirely belong to the
Bishop of Exeter’s great manor of Lanwhitton.</p>

<p>I shall begin therewith: Mr. Camden tells you that
this was one of the three manors given by Edward the
elder about the year 905 to the Bishop of Kirton, from
whom, on the union of the sees, it came to the Bishop of
Exeter, in whose hands it hath ever since continued.</p>

<p>By an extract from the Register of John de Grandison,
Bishop of Exeter, from 1327 to 1369, it appears that at
<!--006.png--><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a><span class="pageno">2</span>
an Assizes held at Launceston, before John de Berwick,
Walter de Burveton, Henry Spigurnel, John Ralph, and
Henry de Stainton, Justices Itinerant, Thomas Bishop of
Exeter was summoned to answer to our Lord the King by
what authority he held the different royalties in the manors
of Lanwhitton, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Germans, and Poulton, and certain other
privileges in Tregear and Penryn, with a free market,
fairs, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>; and free warren over all lands belonging to the
see throughout Cornwall. And the said Bishop, by his
attorney, comes into court and saith, That as to the free
market and fairs, and free warren, that the Lord Henry,
father to our Lord the King that now is, did grant to one
William, lately Bishop of Exeter, his predecessor, the
said liberties to him and his successors for ever; and produced
the said King’s charter for the same. And in
respect to the liberties, he saith, that himself and his
predecessors have held them from time of which there is no
memory, without interruption, and therefore claims their
continuance.</p>

<p>The jurors agree that the said Bishop and his predecessors
had the said liberties, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> in his manor of Penryn;
but as for the manor of Tregear, that he and his
predecessors had the same liberties from his and their villains,
and not from their free tenants, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a tempore quo non extat
memoria, sine intermissione</span>.</p>

<p>The Bishops of Exeter have been accustomed to farm
out their manor on lives to several gentlemen. The present
farmers are&mdash;Francis Manaton, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, William Clowberry,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, and Edward Bennet, of Hexworthy, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr></p>

<p>I now come to treat of the remarkable places of the said
manor; and first of the barton Hexworthy.</p>

<p>Hexworthy&mdash;the field of reeds, corrupted, by pronunciation,
from hesk or hesken, a reed or bulrush, and the
Saxon worthing, a field. This place has been for three
or four descents the seat of the family of Bennet. The
present possessor, Edward Bennet, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, has been twice
married; first, to a daughter of Sir Walter Moyle, of
<!--007.png--><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a><span class="pageno">3</span>
Bake; and, secondly, to a daughter of &mdash;&mdash; Coffin, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, of
Portledge, in Devonshire. The arms of Bennet are <abbr title="Gules">Gu.</abbr>
a Bezant between three demi-lions <abbr title="Argent">Arg.</abbr></p>

<p>Bullsworthy, id est, the Bull’s-field (qu.? <abbr title="Editor">Ed.</abbr>) This
was lately the seat, by copy of court roll under the farmers
of this manor, of John Coren, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, who in the reign of
Queen Anne was in the Commission of the Peace, and
Deputy-Surveyor of the Duchy of Cornwall, who dying
without issue, left his estate to his widow; and on her decease
it fell to the three gentlemen above-named, lessees
of the manor. Mr. Coren derived himself from the Corens
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s, in Branwell, and gave for his arms,
<abbr title="Argent">Arg.</abbr> a millrind between two martlets in fess <abbr title="Sable">Sab.</abbr> He left
a part of his estate to a younger brother, now (November
1735) a captain of foot.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The church of this parish, although gone much into
decay, is said to exhibit appearances of venerable antiquity.
In it is a monument to the memory of Richard Bennet,
counsellor at law, who died in 1619. And another of artificial
stone, with the following inscription:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center small">Underneath lieth the body of Richard Coffin, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr><br />
and also some of his nearest and dearest relations,<br />
who resided for many generations at Hexworthy, in this county.<br />
He was the son of Edward Bennet and Honor his wife,<br />
daughter of Richard Coffin, of Portledge in Devon, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr><br />
and Honor his wife, who was daughter of Edmund Prideaux, of Padstow, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr><br />
in this county.<br />
Dying without issue, in him ended the lineal descent of<br />
the families of Bennet and Coffin.<br />
He was born in the year 1715, and died <abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 30, 1796.</p>

<p>This gentleman gave Hexworthy to one of his relations,
the Prideauxes of Padstow.</p>

<p>The lessees of the great manor having neglected to renew
their holding, it reverted to Doctor George Lavington,
<!--008.png--><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a><span class="pageno">4</span>
Bishop of Exeter fom 1746 to 1762, who made a new lease
in favour of his only child, afterwards married to the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
Nutcombe Nutcombe, Chancellor of the Cathedral, in
whose three daughters or their families it still remains.</p>

<p>The Editor cannot quit this parish without noticing that
here resided as rector during many years the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Robert
Walker, who once entertained thoughts of really executing,
what is now feebly attempted, a parochial history of
Cornwall. The Editor well remembers waiting on him
in 1787, to make inquiries respecting some of his own
ancestors, when Mr. Walker, then far advanced in life,
received him with the utmost kindness, insisted on his
taking refreshments, and when they were declined on the
ground of giving him trouble, Mr. Walker remarked, that
such trouble was at once a duty and a pleasure, since our
most important business in this world was to accommodate
each other, and to make each other happy.</p>

<p>In a letter from him dated November the 9th, of the
same year, the parish is written Lewhitton.</p>

<p>Mr. Walker is said to have been born in 1699.</p>

<p>Lawhitton measures 2455 statute acres.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DOCTOR BOASE.</p>

<p>The rocks of this parish are very similar to those of
Launceston. Where argillaceous earth, either alone or in
conjunction with carbonate of lime, prevails in these rocks,
the soil produced from them is very fertile; but sometimes
silica is so predominant, that the ground is comparatively
barren.</p>

<p>Lelant is in the hundred of Penwith, and hath to the

Lan, a church, so as to signify the church place. It is
dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Uny, and therefore hath the adjunct
of Uny Lelant mostly used in writings. But Leland
calls it Lannant; and if that be the right name, it is a
church in a valley. In the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Taxatio Ecclesiastica</span> of Pope

<p>The church of this parish is situated in the midst of
sand, at the very extreme point inclosed by the sea, and
by the estuary of Hayle. It is said to have been almost
entirely covered towards the early part of the last century
by one of these immense drifts of shell-sand which occasionally
overwhelm this coast, originating, as is supposed,
<!--010.png--><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><span class="pageno">6</span>
from the Nympha Bank, lying about midway between the
Land’s End and Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clear. The Editor has in his
possession the following receipt for money contributed by
his collateral ancestor towards clearing the church, and
accommodating it for the celebration of divine service;
which was then done, and the old church restored&mdash;not a
new one constructed, as some writers on Cornwall have
erroneously stated.</p>

<p class="blockquote">August 11th, 1738.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Mr. Hugh Powley and Mr. John Pears received of Mr.
Henry Davies for bounty money towards Lelant church,
twenty-six pounds five shillings, as appears by the church
book.</p>

<p class="p0 sigright"><span class="sc">Thomas Kniveton.</span></p>

<p>Several great inundations of sand appear to have covered
this coast at distant and uncertain periods; but the comminuted
shells are perpetually increasing on the sea-shore,
from whence they are drifted over the adjacent
lands: their progress has, however, been checked, and in
some places almost arrested, by the simple expedient of
planting the Arundo Arenaria of Linnæus, named by
others, Calamagrestis Arenaria. This rush grows readily
in the sand, where it mechanically opposes all motion on
the surface, and ultimately favours the production of a
grassy turf.</p>

<p>Tradition asserts, that a town of some magnitude, having
a market, and the establishment of a custom-house, stood
near the church, when Hayle afforded deep water without
the aid of artificial works, and before <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives had
risen into consequence. Foundations of houses have undoubtedly
been discovered here under the sand; and the
tradition is somewhat confirmed by a distinction paid to
the principal village, which is universally called Lelant
Town, and not Church Town, as in other parishes.</p>

<p>The town is divided into two separate portions, usually
distinguished as higher or lower, but the latter was formerly
called Tredreath, the town on the sand or beach.
<!--011.png--><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a><span class="pageno">7</span>
This parish has several other villages: Brunion, Trecrobben,
giving name to the most picturesque granite hill in
that whole district, Polpear, Trink, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>In the taxation of Pope Nicholas, Lelant, under the
name of Lanvanta or Laventa, is rated at 15<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>
13<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 4<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span>
without any notice of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives or Towednack.</p>

<p>Lelant, as the mother church, is alone of the three
parishes provided with a glebe; but this land, although
more extensive than what falls, on an average, to neighbouring
incumbents, is rendered of very little value, and
totally unfitted for a residence, by the encroachment of
sand. An ancient vicarage house is believed to have disappeared
with the town at the last great inundation, and
the parish has remained longer than the period of memory,
without a resident clergyman; but in this very year (1835)
the Reverend Uriah Tonkin having been most liberally
accommodated with an elevated situation at some distance
from the sea, by Mr. Praed, is now constructing a house
adequate to every thing that can be wished.</p>

<p>The rectorial tithes are said by Mr. Lysons to have been
given by Robert de Cardinham, in the reign of Richard
Cœur de Lion, to the monastery of Tywardreath; but that
afterwards they were appropriated to the College of Crediton.
Although this college has in part survived the
general devastation of King Henry the Eighth, yet the tithes
of Lelant were taken from it, and after passing through
various hands, they now belong to Mr. Praed.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons also states, but without giving any authority,
that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Uny (a brother of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Herygh), patron of Lelant,
Crowan, and Redruth, was buried in this church.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Uny and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Herygh ever existed at all, they were
probably two of the missionaries from Ireland.</p>

<p>The parish feast is celebrated on the nearest Sunday to
Candlemas day, but supposed to be in commemoration of
the Saint.</p>

<p>Trembetha is said to have been the seat of John Hals,
one of the judges in the reign of King Henry the Fifth,
<!--012.png--><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a><span class="pageno">8</span>
and to have been sold by him to the Godolphins. In the
time of Queen Elizabeth it belonged to the Mahons. The
barton and manor are now the joint property of Mr.
Praed and Mr. Champernowne, of Dartington, near Totnes,
as to two-thirds; and the remaining share is divided
between Mr. Tremayne, Mr. Rodd, and Mrs. Stephens,
as coheirs of the family of Hearle.</p>

<p>Lelant was for centuries the residence of three old and
respectable families&mdash;Praed, Hoskin, and Pawley. The
Hoskins still remain possessed of their ancient freehold,
and other property; and Mr. Henry Hoskins, the present
head of the family, resides in a house at the northern extremity
of Tredreath, or Lower Lelant Town, bearing
all the marks which distinguished the dwellings of private
gentlemen in the times of the Tudors or Plantagenets.
The Pawleys are extinct, having declined through a series
of years; Goonwhyn, or Gunwin, (the White Croft)
where the family had long resided, together with some
other remnants of property, came to Miss Jane Pawley,
sufficient, however, to give her the reputation of an heiress:
but misfortunes and disgraceful conduct reduced her so
very low, that the Editor recollects her soliciting charity
from those who once looked up to her superior station;
and this representative of an ancient family closed her
mortal career in a parish workhouse.</p>

<p>The Praeds are also extinct; but the name has, with
singular felicity, arrived at tenfold splendour in a new
dynasty.</p>

<p>The original family became at last represented by two
brothers: the elder distinguished as Colonel Praed, married
a Basset of Tehidy, but died soon after, leaving all the
personal property to his widow: the younger brother succeeded
to the real estate; but having been unsuccessfully
engaged in trade, and finding the farms mostly leased on
lives with the payment of small quit-rents, according to
the custom of those times, he became more and more
embarrassed; till, meeting with a gentleman of the family
<!--013.png--><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><span class="pageno">9</span>
of Mackworth, in Glamorganshire, bred to the higher
department of the law, he arranged with this gentleman,
that on being freed from all pecuniary difficulties, and
receiving a certain annuity for life, the whole Cornish
estate should be transferred to Mr. Mackworth; on the
further conditions of his taking the name of Praed, and
what seems almost ludicrous, of his engaging, so far as the
consent of one party could be sufficient, to marry Miss
Penrose, of Penrose, near Helston, the heiress-at-law to
Mr. Praed’s estate.</p>

<p>Mr. Praed died about the years 1716 or 1717, when
Mr. Mackworth came into possession, having performed
every engagement to the utmost of his power; for the
Editor recollects having heard from his son, the late Mr.
Humphrey Mackworth Praed, that his father went to
Penrose in execution of the condition dependent on
another; but that, so far from obtaining success, he found
some difficulty in escaping with his life.</p>

<p>The validity of the transfer was ultimately disputed on
the part of Miss Penrose; and Mr. Humphrey Mackworth
Praed has told the Editor that he was present at the trial
in his nurse’s arms, when the agreement was finally established.
The lady married a gentleman of the name of
Pearse, and left an only daughter, who married Mr. Cumming;
and their great-grandson, Sir Alexander Cumming
Gordon, of Elginshire, is the present representative of the
former family of Trevethow.</p>

<p>Mr. Mackworth Praed settled at Trevethow, where he
was succeeded by his eldest son, Mr. Humphrey Mackworth
Praed, one of the most distinguished men in his
adopted country, for abilities, acquirements, wit, knowledge
of the world, kindness, and unbounded hospitality.
He once represented the county in Parliament, and on
another occasion the borough of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives. He married a
lady of the eminent family of Forrester, in Shropshire,
widow of Sir Bryant Broughton Delves, and had six children:
William, his eldest son and heir; Herbert, Rector of
<!--014.png--><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><span class="pageno">10</span>
Ludgvan, who died in early life; and four daughters,&mdash;Catherine,
Mary, Arabella, and Julia.</p>

<p>Mary married the Reverend William Sandys, Vicar of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Minver, and died without leaving any family. The
other three never married.</p>

<p>Mr. William Praed married Miss Backwell, of Tyringham,
in Buckinghamshire, eventually sole heiress to her
very opulent family. He represented <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives in several
Parliaments, and Banbury in one.</p>

<p>Endowed with a strong mind and with an active disposition,
Mr. Praed did not confine his public services to the
discharge of duties in the House of Commons. To him
the nation is mainly indebted for one of the most useful
and most successful of our public works&mdash;The Grand
Junction Canal.</p>

<p>Three extensive chalk ridges issue from the great central
nucleus forming Salisbury Plain; the most southern
terminates at Beachy-head, constituting what is called the
South Downs. The middle range, passing through Hampshire,
Surrey, and Kent, extends to Dover, inclosing
between them the wealds of Kent and Sussex, with the
Hastings sand formation, and the great alluvial deposits
of Romney and Pevensey Marshes. The northern range
is still more extensive than the other two: this, passing
through Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire, traverses
Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire; then, after being cut
through by the Wash, re-appears in Yorkshire, and finally
terminates its long course at Flamborough Head. These
two latter ranges intercept all water communication between
the capital and the interior of England, except by the
Thames, which finds its way through the northern ridge of
chalk above Reading. Most river navigations beyond the
reach of tides, are impeded by shallows in summer, by floods
in winter, by artificial rights of mills, drainages, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, all of
which are avoided by the Grand Junction Canal, which,
availing itself of cross valleys, and perforating narrow
ridges, has opened an inland navigation from the metropolis
<!--015.png--><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><span class="pageno">11</span>
to the British Channel, to the Irish Sea, and to the
German Ocean.</p>

<p>Mr. William Praed closed his useful and honourable
career of life at Trevethow, in <abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr> 1833, having completed
his eighty-fourth year; and is succeeded by his
eldest son, Mr. James Praed, recently elected member for
Buckinghamshire, the county in which he principally resides.
Mr. Praed married Miss Chaplin, of Lincolnshire, and has
several children.</p>

<p>If this distinguished family should now unfortunately
be lost to Cornwall, it is curious to remark that, after
remaining there much above a century, no permanent
connexion has been formed, and not a single relative will
be left behind.</p>

<p>Trevethow is by its natural situation one of the finest
places in the west of Cornwall. The house looks to the
estuary of Hayle, over a park variegated by rising ground
and vales; and immediately behind the house stands Trecrobben
or Trencroben-hill, crowned by an ancient fortress,
corresponding with those described by Dr. Barham
in the third volume of the Transactions of the Geological
Society of Cornwall; this hill is the last towards the killas
formation of a granite district, extending from the
Land’s End, and covered with rocks of a magnitude to
create strong impressions of grandeur. The house was so
much enlarged and decorated by Mr. Humphrey Mackworth
Praed, as almost to claim him for its founder; and it
is sheltered by trees more numerous and of a larger size
than can usually be found in a country unfavourable to
their growth.</p>

<p>But the great artificial ornament of this place is its extensive
plantations. Mr. Humphrey Mackworth Praed displayed
on this comparatively trifling subject, the same
acumen which distinguished him in matters of importance,
throughout a long life. Having observed a single pinaster
fir, the Pinus Pinaster of Linnæus, growing in an exposed
situation, and braving the violence of our west wind, Mr.
<!--016.png--><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><span class="pageno">12</span>
Praed immediately conjectured that this tree might be
rendered available not merely for ornament, but as affording
a shelter for better trees; the experiment was immediately
tried, and with complete success.</p>

<p>The pinaster loses all its beauty when it gets beyond
the dimensions of a shrub: its wood in this climate is almost
useless, and no tree ceases to live after so short a period;
but it grows rapidly at first in all situations, and almost in
any ground, so that mixed with deciduous trees, and
planted round the exterior, it acts as a nurse, and the
office is fully performed long before the termination of its
short existence.</p>

<p>By this use of the pinaster fir, Cornwall is now acquiring
valuable and decorative plantations of the best timber trees,
for all which it is indebted to the example given by Mr.
Praed.</p>

<p>Lelant measures 3,279 statute acres.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DOCTOR BOASE.</p>

<p>The western part of this parish rests on granite, which is
generally coarse-grained and crystalline, often with large
porphyritic crystals of felspar; here and there it contains
beds of porphyry (elvan courses), and also of shorl rock,
sometimes in masses, but more frequently in the form of
large and irregular veins. This granite has been productive
of metallic ores, and more particularly of tin.
The eastern part is composed of rocks belonging to the
porphyritic series. The principal varieties are felspar
rock, both massive and schistose, and green-stone. The
soil derived from these rocks, as is often the case near
granite, is on some spots very fertile. Some land near
<!--017.png--><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><span class="pageno">13</span>
the entrance into Hayle is covered with testaceous sand,
so common in the vicinity of all the bays and inlets of the
sea on the north coast of Cornwall, and which, whenever it
is unprotected by vegetation, is drifted by the winds over
the uncultivated lands. Nature has pointed out the remedy
for this evil to be the diffusion and increase of arenaceous
plants.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">The Editor.</span>&mdash;Whele Reath, a mine on the extreme
western border of this parish, where it joins Towednack,
has proved more productive of tin than any other mine
except Whele Vor; and it has been prosecuted to a depth
unexampled till within these few years, even in mines of
copper.</p>

<p>At the other extremity of the parish, near the sea-shore,
both copper and tin have been found in the belt of green
stone which generally interposes between the granite and
the sea-shore.</p>

but since that time it having gone with the rest of
the Duchy of Cornwall, and accounted for accordingly, I
need not say any more of it here; and so come to treat of
the</p>

<p class="p2 center smaller unindent">TOWN OF LESKEARD.</p>

<p>Mr. Willis, in his <abbr title="Notitia">Rot.</abbr> Parliamentaria, <abbr title="volume two page">vol. ii. p.</abbr> 27,
gives this account of it: “This borough was, in like manner
as spoken of in Launceston, held in the time of the
Conqueror by Robert Earl of Morton and Cornwall; and
afterwards, as that did, belonged to Richard, brother to
King Henry the Third, created Earl of Cornwall in the
15th year of his reign, who made this place a free borough,
and granted to the burgesses all those liberties and free
customs which he, by his charter, had before granted to his
<!--019.png--><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><span class="pageno">15</span>
burgesses of Launceston and Helston. This charter is
dated the 5th of June, anno 1240, in the 24th year of the
reign of his brother King Henry the Third, about ten
years after the date of Launceston charter, as I guess. To
this Richard succeeded Edmund Earl of Cornwall, his son,
who in the <abbr title="third">3d</abbr> year of the reign of Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> granted this
whole burgh, with the rent of the same, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> and toll of the
market and fairs, and all fines, mulcts, and perquisites
thereof belonging to him and his heirs, in fee farm, at the
rent of £18 sterling; upon which conditions the said borough
being leased to the townsmen, has remained in their
hands ever since, and the corporation at present enjoy the
profits of the fairs and markets, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> which yield them about
£200 per annum. The royalty of this borough has been
in like manner as that at Launceston, vested in the Duchy
ever since Edward the Third’s time; and the Dukes of
Cornwall, as tenants of the Crown, have received the said
fee-farm rent till the reign of the late King William, who
alienated the same, and gave it to the present Lord Somers,
to whom the corporation pay the abovesaid chief rent of
£18.”</p>

<p>Leland, Itinerary, <abbr title="volume three">vol. iii.</abbr> lob. 19, saith, “The towne
knowlegith freedom and privileges by the gift of Richard,
King of Romanes and Earl of Cornewaul.” Perhaps by
him this place was antiently incorporated; but the present
charter doth not say when or by whom, for thus runs the
last Visitation: “The towne and burrough of Liskeret, alias
Liskerd, was antiently incorporated by the name of Mayor
and Burgesses of Liskeret, alias Liskerd, and re-incorporated
the 6th day of July, in the 29th year of Queen Elizabeth,
by the same name of Mayor and Burgesses, and by
that name to have perpetual succession; and enabled in
law to purchase lands, tenements, and liberties, and likewise
to assign the same, and by the same name to plead
and be impleaded; and that the borough and corporation
should consist of 9 Burgesses, which shall be called the
Common Councell of the said burrough, whereof one for
<!--020.png--><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><span class="pageno">16</span>
the time being shall be yearly chosen for Mayor, to have
power to chuse a Steward and Recorder. That the Mayor
and Burgesses shall have a common seal for their affairs;
and that the Mayor and Recorder shall be Justices of the
Peace within the said burrough (of which new corporation,
granted by Queen Elizabeth, John Hunkin was the first
Mayor), with diverse other privileges and immunities, as by
their charter doth appear. And at this present visitation,
the 12th day of October, 1620, was Edward Chapman,
Mayor, <abbr title="Saint">Sᵗ</abbr> William Wrey, Knight, Recorder, John Hunkin,
<abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> High Steward, Thomas Jane, John Vosper,
Martin Sampson, John Pott, Jeffrie Clarke, John Taperell,
and William Grege, Chief Burgesses, and Walter Nicholls,
Town Clark, of the said town and burrough.”</p>

<p>Mr. Willis goes on: “As for the right of election of
Members of Parliament, ’tis vested in these nine capital
burgesses and fifteen assistants, with others who are free of
the borough, as many of the neighbouring gentlemen are;
so that the whole number of electors is near about 100,
who are all sworn freemen. The town of Leskeard is very
large and populous, and contains (as I am informed) about
500 houses. It has a very considerable market, and perhaps
the greatest in this county. It was in Leland’s time
the best except Bodmin, which it much exceeds now, [this
is a great mistake,] as the town does in buildings. This
being in all respects one of, if not the biggest and best
built in Cornwall [I take Falmouth to exceed by much
every way, and so doth Truro too in building, if not bigness];
’tis situate partly on rocky hills, and partly in a
bottom. On the eastern ascent of the hill stands the
church (of which more by and by). On the north side of
the town stood the castle, of which Leland speaks thus:
‘There was a castle on an hill in the town side, by north
from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin. It is now all in ruin; fragments and
pieces of waulles yet stand. The site of it is magnificent,
and looketh over all the town. This castle was the Earles
of Cornwall.’”</p>

<p><!--021.png--><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span class="pageno">17</span>
Mr. Willis continues: “In this town is an admirable
conduit of water (this Leland too mentions), which plentifully
supplies the streets about the market-place, which
lies in a bottom about the middle of the borough; and
from thence branch several other streets, divers of which
lie on steep ascents. The town is near four furlongs over
every way, and in some parts the houses stand scattered,
though the streets are generally broad. This is one of the
towns for coinage of tin (but there are hardly &mdash;&mdash; blocks of
tin coined here in a whole year, the works in its neighbourhood
being rather neglected than worn out); and was
remarkable, anno 1642, for the defeat of the Parliament
army by Sir Ralph Hopton, a memorial of which was put
up in the church. The market, in Leland’s time mentioned
to be observed on the Monday, is now kept on Saturday.
The town hall stands on stone pillars, and is a
good building. At the top is a clock-turret, having four
dials. It was erected about the year 1707, by Mr. Dolben,
one of the Members for this town, at near £200 expense.
There has been given also to this corporation
very handsome presents of plate, with two large silver
maces well gilt, as are several of their silver cups, round
one of which, in most constant use, is this engraved:</p>

<p class="p0 center" lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Qui fallit poculum, fallit in omnibus.’”</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Leskeard still continues a place of considerable trade,
and distinguished by its excellent market, although in relative
importance it does not maintain the station among
towns in the county assigned to it a hundred years since
by Mr. Tonkin. Of late years, several persons possessed
of large properties have decorated the environs with excellent
houses; and one gentleman of the town, Mr. Lyne,
has brought home from successful trade and speculation,
conducted at Lisbon by himself and his uncles during two-thirds
of a century, a fortune that may be denominated
<!--022.png--><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span class="pageno">18</span>
princely. Leskeard has benefited beyond most other towns
by the recent improvements of roads, and by a canal from
the port of Looe, which affords a cheap and easy conveyance
for lime, the most important of all manures in that
district.</p>

<p>This town has been the residence, if not the origin, of
several distinguished persons.</p>

<p>Dr. William Jane, Regius Professor of Divinity at
Oxford in the time of Charles the Second, was from hence.
And I believe that Mr. Jane, for many years master of the
grammar-school at Truro, was his nephew; and this gentleman’s
son, first a student at Christchurch, and afterwards
Rector of Iron Acton, in Gloucestershire, bore a
conspicuous part among the learned divines of his day.</p>

<p>From hence also originated the family of Taunton; of
whom Mr. William Elias Taunton, knighted on some occasion
of the King visiting Oxford, attained the highest
eminence in that city as a legal practitioner; and he had
the satisfaction of seeing his eldest son attain the proud
situation of a judge. Of this family is also Richard Taunton,
M.D. distinguished by his eager pursuit of all scientific
acquirements, as well as by his medical skill; now resident
at Truro. To this gentleman’s liberality the Editor is indebted
for the original manuscript of Mr. Hals’ Parochial
History, the foundation of this work.</p>

<p>Among eminent persons residing at Leskeard, it is impossible
to omit Mr. Haydon, for many years master of the
grammar-school. Of his classical acquirements it may be
sufficient to say that Dr. Cornelius Cardew, who has been
mentioned under <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> <a name="chg_1" id="chg_1"></a>Ewan, and must be again under Truro,
was his favourite scholar; but, in addition to literature,
Mr. Haydon acquired a profound knowledge of mathematics
and of astronomy; and in these, the most exact and the
most noble of sciences, he was not content with theory, and
with the practical result of labours carried on by others.
Mr. Haydon provided himself with various instruments, of
a size and accuracy rarely possessed by individuals at that
<!--023.png--><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><span class="pageno">19</span>
period; and with those he made important observations on
the transit of Venus in June 1769; and for a long time all
the longitudes of places in the West of England were deduced
from Mr. Haydon’s determination of Leskeard. He
ultimately retired to the family living of Okeford, in Devonshire,
and was succeeded in the school by Mr. Lyne,
whose grandson has been noticed for his acquisition of an
immense fortune.</p>

<p>A gentleman of very singular habits flourished at Leskeard
through a large portion of the eighteenth century,
the last of an ancient and respectable family, Trehawke.
No one stood more prominent for ability, knowledge of
business, or for integrity; all disputes were referred to
his arbitration, and every one pressed eagerly to obtain
his advice; but habits of parsimony grew on him to such an
extent, that the most ridiculous tales were circulated of his
private savings, without, however, detracting from the estimation
in which he was otherwise held. Having decupled
his fortune, he left the whole to a distant relation, Mr.
Kekewich, since Member for Exeter, a gentleman altogether
worthy of so splendid a gift.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons says, “In the town of Liskeard was a nunnery
of poor Clares, founded and endowed by Richard
King of the Romans,” but of which he had not been able
to obtain any further account. But this seems to be a
mistake; as Richard King of the Romans died in 1271,
and the Nuns of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clare were first brought into England
by Blanch Queen of Navarre, and wife of Edmund Earl of
Lancaster, about twenty years afterwards. The monastic
remains appear, moreover, too magnificent for an establishment
of Nuns Minories, or Poor Clares, the female
branch of the begging monks or friars instituted by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Francis.</p>

<p>The castle walls have entirely disappeared, but the elevated
site is still conspicuous; it is surrounded with trees,
and the centre is occupied by the school-house.</p>

<p>The church is among the largest in Cornwall, and its
<!--024.png--><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><span class="pageno">20</span>
south wall, like that of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neot, is embattled, and also ornamented
by a handsome porch. There is a tradition
which describes this church as being decorated with two
towers, one on each side of the building, but taken down
in the year 1627. The existing western tower is very inferior
to the church.</p>

<p>The great tithes of this parish were appropriated to the
Priory of Launceston. They were granted by Queen Elizabeth
to a Mr. Harris, and they have recently been sold
in parcels to the various proprietors of land. Mr. Honey,
who holds the vicarage, is also patron.</p>

<p>In the church are various monuments to the family of
Trehawke, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> and one to Joseph Wadham, who died in
1707; being the last of that family, founders of Wadham
college, Oxford.</p>

<p>The house and the room are still shewn which were occupied
by King Charles the First in August 1644, before
the surrender at Fowey of the army commanded by Lord
Essex.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons gives an account of the various persons and
estates in this parish. The chief proprietors are Mr. Kekewich
and Mrs. Connock. The extensive property of the
Moreheads has been entirely sold in various lots, and their
manor of Lamellian, or Lamellin, now belongs to the Editor
of this work.</p>

<p>The borough, made co-extensive with the parish by the
Reform Act of 1832, sends one Member to Parliament.</p>

<p>There cannot be a question as to the first syllable in the
name of this town being les, a court, or inclosure; and the
second may probably be derived, as Mr. Tonkin conjectures,
from kaer, a fortress; but in times when every thing
was referred to the French language, les became changed
into lis, and a flower-de-luce was adopted on the town seal.</p>

<p>The parish measures 7126 statute acres.</p>

<p>The rocks of this parish are principally on the boundary
of the porphyritic and calcareous series; partaking of the
former in the northern part, and of the latter in the
southern. The former sometimes nearly resemble hornblende
schist; and, gradually leaving the hornblende, they
pass into a coarse, lamellar, argillaceous rock, of a dirty
yellowish brown colour, irregularly and indistinctly marked
with blue spots. There are several large quarries in this
rock round the town of Leskeard, where the stone is extensively
used for building. It very nearly approaches in character
to that of Bodmin, but is not quite similar.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The Editor.</span> At a short distance from the town, on
the road side leading towards Plymouth, occurs a soft
micaceous schist, of a deep yellow tinge, which was most
unfortunately mistaken for an ore of gold, about fifty years
since, by a Mr. Hoskin, of Leskeard, and by his son, a
clergyman, who, in utter ignorance of modern science, expended
considerable sums of money in erecting machinery,
for the prosecution of pursuits so vain as the raising of
gold ore and extracting the metal.</p>

<p>I have always imagined, whether rightly or not I am not
certain, that this place, instead of giving name to the hundred,
changed its own, when this was divided into two
hundreds, Strathan and Lesnewith; having been formerly
but one hundred, called Trigg Major, as they still continue
in respect to ecclesiastical affairs; and if so, then the name
signifies the New Court.</p>

<p>I fancy this to be the same which is called in Domesday

the manors which William the Conqueror gave to his half-brother
the Earl of Morton, with the earldom of Cornwall.</p>

<p>Under the head of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cleather, a peculiar calcareous
rock was noticed, consisting of a variety of hornblende and
calc spar, either distinctly conjoined in a granular or laminated
form, or so intimately blended, as to form an homogeneous
green rock. A large bed of this peculiar rock occurs
at Grylls or Garles, near the western boundary of the
parish. An attempt was made here to burn this rock as a
limestone for agricultural purposes; but after several trials
it was abandoned; for, unless great care be taken in selecting
those parts alone in which calc spar mainly abounds,
the whole charge of the kiln vitrifies, or runs into a slag,
owing to the great fusibility of hornblende, the other constituent
of this calcareous rock.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">HALS.</p>

<p>The manuscript relating to this parish is lost.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>Lestwithiel is in the hundred of Powder, and is surrounded
to the west, north, and south, by Lanlivery; to
the east it has Fowy river between it and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Winnow. As
for the name, I take it to be a corruption of Les-uchel, i. e.
the lofty place, as having been from all antiquity the chief
seat of the Dukes, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> of Cornwall. Mr. Camden in Cornwall
saith, “the Uzella of Ptolemy is seated, and has not
yet quite lost its name, being called at this day Lestuthiell,
from its situation. Now uchel, in British, signifies the
same as <em>high</em> and <em>lofty</em>.” But of this more when we come
to describe the town. As for Mr. Carew’s derivation, who
calls it Lostwithiel, from the Cornish Losswithiall, which
in English, saith he, signifieth a lion’s tail, it is so ridiculous,
as not to be worth repeating; neither doth the word
carry that sense. This parish is a vicarage, valued in the
King’s books at £2. 13<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 4<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span></p>

<p>The Duke of Cornwall is patron. The incumbent Mr.
Baron, who succeeded Mr. Whiteford.</p>

<p>This church is not valued in <abbr title="Taxatio Beneficiorum">Tax. Benefic.</abbr> anno 1291;
and was then appropriated to the Priory of Bodmin.</p>

<p class="p2">THE TOWN AND BOROUGH OF LESTWITHIEL,</p>

<p>“Reputed,” saith Mr. Willis, “the ancient Uzella of
Ptolemy, lies situated on the river Uzella,” (I wonder how
Mr. Willis came to be guilty of this mistake, since both
Leland and Camden, whom he quotes, tell him that it lies
on the river Fowy,) “from which it more probably had its
<!--029.png--><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><span class="pageno">25</span>
name, as the learned Camden thinks” (Mr. Camden says
as I have quoted him above,) “than from Carew’s interpretation
of the word Lestwithiel, which he would have to
signify in English, lion’s tail. This town is reputed in former
times to have stood on a high hill, where the old castle
of Lestormel showeth its ruins, which with a park thereto
belonging, lies on the north side of the town” (and is in
the parish of Lanlivery, for which reason it is not treated
of here). “In the park was a Chapel of the Trinity, long
since defaced, as are the public buildings of the town, insomuch
that little remains of them; though some small
parts are repaired, and made use of for the prisons and
courts belonging to the Tin Stannaries, which are appointed
to be kept here, this being one of the coinage towns.”</p>

<p>Before I go on any further with Mr. Willis, it may be
proper to insert at length what Mr. Camden saith of it.
“More within the land, on the same river (Fowy), the Uzella
of Ptolemy is seated; and has not quite lost its name, being
called at this day Lestuthiell, from its situation; for it was
upon a high hill, where is Listormel, an ancient castle;
though now it is removed into the valley. Now Uchel,
British, signifies the same as high and lofty; from whence
Uxellodunum of Gaule is so termed, because the town being
built upon a mountain, has a steep rugged ascent every
way. This in the British history is called Pen-Uchel-Coit,
a high mountain in a wood, by which some will have Exeter
meant. But the situation assigned it by Ptolemy, and
the name it has to this day, do sufficiently evince it to have
been the ancient Uzella. Now it is a little town, and not
at all populous; for the channel of the river Fowy, which
in the last age used to carry the tide up to the very town,
and bring vessels of burthen, is now so stopped up by the
sands coming from the tin-mines, that it is too shallow for
barges; and indeed, all the havens in this county are in
danger of being choaked up by their sands. However, it
is the county town, where the Sheriff every month holds the
County Court, and the Warden of the Stannaries has his
<!--030.png--><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="pageno">26</span>
prison. For it has the privilege of coinage, by the
favour (as they say) of Edmund Earl of Cornwall, who
formerly had his palace there. But there are two towns
which especially eclipse the glory of this Uzella,&mdash;Leskerd
to the east, and Bodman to the north.” Now
to return to Mr. Willis. “It is a very ancient corporation,
belonging to the Duchy, having had great
privileges conferred upon it by Richard Earl of Cornwall
(so saith Leland, Itinerary, <abbr title="volume three folio">vol. III. fol.</abbr> 16,) who, when
he was King of the Romans, in the twelfth year of his
reign, by charter dated at Wallington, made Lostwithiel
and Penknek (alias Penkneth, in the parish of Lanliversey,
for Lanlivery, saith Leland, in the above cited place,) a
place near adjoining, and now part of the borough, one
free burgh, and granted his burgesses a gild mercatory,
<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> When this place was first incorporated, I have not
been informed; but it has returned Members to Parliament
ever since 4 <abbr title="Edward Two">Edw. <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></abbr> and once before,
<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> 23 <abbr title="Edward One">Edw. I.</abbr>
The Representatives are chosen by the majority of the
Corporation, which consists of seven capital burgesses
(whereof one is Mayor), and seventeen assistants, in whom,
as I presume, the fee-farm rent of the borough is vested,
who hold the same, or not many years since did, of the
Duchy. This Corporation (otherwise a poor one) holds
also the anchorage in the harbour, and bryhelage of measureable
commodities, as coals, salt, malt, and corn, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> in
the town of Fowey; which port lies lower on this river,
which was navigable to this town before the sands barred it
up. The town of Lestwithiel consists chiefly of two streets,
from east to west, meanly built, and has in it a church (of
which more at the end).</p>

<p>“In August 1644, some soldiers of the Parliament Army,
as may be seen in Dugdale’s Short View of the late Troubles
in England, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 560, defaced several stately edifices in
this town, as the great Hall and Exchequer of the Dukes
of Cornwall, who had their palace here in times past; this
having been formerly reputed the shire town of the county,
<!--031.png--><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a><span class="pageno">27</span>
a small branch of which it yet retaineth, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> the election
of knights of the shire, and keeping the county weights and
measures, which it had assigned by Act of Parliament,
anno 11 <abbr title="Henry Seven">Hen. VII.</abbr> Who held this manor (note, that this
place is no manor, but Penknek,) at the making of Domesday
Book, the learned Dr. Brady could not discover; but
no doubt it was reckoned among those of Robert Earl of
Moreton and Cornwall, the King’s brother. Though in
the reign of Richard <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> it was part of the demesne lands of
Robert de Cardinan Lord of Fowey, who was returned
debtor into the Exchequer, of ten marks due to the King
for having a market at Lestwithiel. <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Robertus de Cardinan
debet decem marcas pro habendo Foro apud Lostwithel. Mag.
Rot. 6 <abbr title="Richard One">Ric. I.</abbr> Rot. 12 a. m. 2, Cornwallia.</cite> However, this
town belonged, <abbr title="tempore Henry Three">temp. Hen. III.</abbr> to Richard Earl of Cornwall,
King Richard’s nephew, upon the death of whose son
Edmund, it became part of the King’s demesne, and anno
7 <abbr title="Edward Three">Edw. III.</abbr> upon the creation of John Earl of Cornwall,
the King’s brother, he had this borough, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter alia</i>, granted
him; which was afterwards assigned to Edward the King’s
son, when he was made Duke of Cornwall, and became,
upon his death, the jointure or dowry of Joan Princess of
Wales, his wife; on whose decease, anno 9 <abbr title="Richard Two">Ric. II.</abbr> the
King granted it to Tho. Holland Earl of Kent, his (half)
brother, who held for life the manors of Lestwithiel and
Camelford; he died in the 20th <abbr title="Richard Two">Ric. II.</abbr> His son Thomas
was created Duke of Surrey, and was beheaded anno
1 <abbr title="Henry Four">Hen. IV.</abbr>”</p>

<p>Mr. Willis having a little mistaken this, I have thus
rectified it. After the death of which last Thomas,
(who also held them for life), Sir John Cornwall, Lord
Fanhope, obtained a grant of the same on account of marrying
Elizabeth, the King’s sister; and obtained a grant of
the same from Henry Prince of Wales to enjoy them during
her life; and afterwards procured it for his own life,
and died accordingly seised thereof in December 1443
(22 <abbr title="Henry Six">Hen. VI.</abbr>) as may be seen in Dugdale’s Baronage.
<!--032.png--><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><span class="pageno">28</span>
The yearly rent of this borough, payable to the Duke of
Cornwall, is in Doddridge’s History of that Duchy, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 108,
set down at £11. 19<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 10½<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span></p>

<p>The town is situated between hills. Boats of ten and
twenty tons come up hither. Here are about 70 houses;
and the manor is in the duchy.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Lestwithiel evidently owes its locality to that which determined
in early times the site of all towns placed on the
banks of navigable rivers. They were universally built on
the highest point to which vessels or boats frequenting the
estuary were capable of being carried by the tide.</p>

<p>Richard Plantagenet might well have been captivated by
the beauties of this place and of the surrounding country,
by its central situation, and by the commanding eminence
of Restormal. Here the last of our real feudal princes,
whether he originally built or only enlarged the castle,
fixed his court, and collected those revenues with which he
is said to have bought from the venal electors of Germany,
the titular office of King of the Romans; conveying, however,
the legal right of succession to the throne of his
grandfather the Emperor Henry the Fifth.</p>

<p class="center small">Nummus ait pro me, nubit Cornubia Romæ.</p>

<p class="p0 small sigright">Carew, 204, Lord Dunstanville’s <abbr title="edition">edit.</abbr></p>

<p>To Richard King of the Romans Lestwithiel is indebted
for the remains of the palace or stannary buildings, and
for its privileges.</p>

<p>The palace, if it was ever the residence of a Prince, has
long since been converted into a prison, with apartments
for occasionally holding the Stannary Courts.</p>

<p>Various charters have been granted to this town. The
last was given in the reign of King George the Second, by
which seven permanent Aldermen annually chose, for one
<!--033.png--><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><span class="pageno">29</span>
year, seventeen other persons, misnamed freemen, who
altogether formed the select body for electing Members of
Parliament. The validity of this charter has never been
contested; but a doubt can scarcely be entertained of all its
being utterly void, at least as to constituting a Parliamentary
grant, on the ground of its entire variance from the
common law of the land: but this question has now lost its
importance in consequence of the Reform enacted in 1832.</p>

<p>The church possesses a character unusual in the west of
England, by having its nave elevated, with a series of windows
above the two ailes. It contains several monuments,
and a curious antique font.</p>

<p>The etymology of this town, like that of Leskeard, has
suffered from modern caprice, the Les having been here
changed into Los; as Dover, from some strange fancy, is
rapidly passing into Dovor.</p>

<p>No separate measurement has been taken of this parish,
not even co-extensive with the modern town; the site is
included in the parishes adjacent.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Levan is situated in the hundred of Penwith, and is
bounded to the west by the ocean, to the north by Sennon,
to the east by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Burian, to the south by the mouth of the
Channel.</p>

<p>This parish taketh its name from the saint to whom the
church is dedicated, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Levine.</p>

<p>It is a daughter church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Burian, forming part of
the deanery of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Burian.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Levan exceeds perhaps every other parish in the
whole county for bold and romantic scenery.</p>

<p>First it possesses Trereen Dinas.</p>

<p>This magnificent promontory has towards the land one of
those ancient entrenchments which so much distinguish the
western coast, from whence the word dinas. There the
point runs out into the sea, rising into a succession of natural
granite <a name="err_1" id="err_1"></a>towers in spires, and aiguilles, and the first
presenting a perpendicular front, is crowned with the far-famed
Loging Rock.</p>

<p>Without calling in question the religious uses made of
this stone in rude and barbarous times, it may be declared
as a certainty to be entirely natural. Among the thousands
of rocks lying scattered in all directions, some possessing
a convex surface have accidentally rested on the flat surface
of another. Many such rocks are known, but this one transcends
in size, and occupies a most commanding station.
The rock has been measured with the greatest care, and it is
<!--035.png--><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><span class="pageno">31</span>
believed to weigh about ninety tons, yet any one, by applying
his shoulder to the edge, and favouring the vibrations, can
easily cause the stone to log through a very sensible angle.</p>

<p>Doctor Borlase, in his most learned and ingenious speculations
on the religion and policy of the Druids, paid considerable
attention to rock monuments in general, and especially
to this, the most remarkable of all. In <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 180 of the
Antiquities, second edition, Doctor Borlase says, “In the
parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Levan, Cornwall, there is a promontory called
Castle Treryn. This cape consists of three distinct groupes
of rocks. On the western side of the middle groupe, near
the top, lies a very large stone, so evenly poised, that any
hand may move it to or fro; but the extremities of its base
are at such a distance from each other, and so well secured
by their nearness to the stone which it stretches itself upon,
that it is morally impossible that any lever, or indeed force
(however applied in a mechanical way) can remove it from
its present situation.”</p>

<p>This rather over-strong expression piqued the vanity of
a gallant and intrepid officer, commanding an armed vessel
on the coast, in 1824, who maintained that nothing could
be impossible to the courage and skill of British seamen,
and therefore, attended by ten or twelve of his men, Lieutenant
Goldsmith, nephew of the celebrated novelist and
poet (for it would even be unjust to withhold his name, as
connected with a transaction on the whole redounding to
his credit), went on the eighth of April to the rock, and
there, by a continued application of their united strength,
they threw this huge mass into vibrations of such extent as
to cause the convex surface at last to slide from its horizontal
base, most fortunately in the direction opposite to
that in which they stood. The rock was saved from falling
to the ground, and from thence probably into the sea, by a
narrow chasm which caught it in the descent.</p>

<p>Mr. Goldsmith having thus achieved what had been declared
impossible by the highest authority that Cornwall
could produce, must have congratuled himself on such complete
<!--036.png--><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><span class="pageno">32</span>
success; but the sensations of all the neighbourhood
were entirely at variance from those of the gallant officer;
fears were even entertained for his life; and a meeting of
the Magistrates and principal persons was contemplated,
for the purpose of representing the affair to Government:
but the Editor of this work being then in London, and
having the honour of being known to all the Lords of the
Admiralty, he went there, and representing the exploit
that had been performed in the light of an indiscreet frolic,
he proposed that the Admiralty should lend a proper apparatus,
and send it from Plymouth, while he on his part
would endeavour to raise an adequate sum of money; and
that Lieutenant Goldsmith, having thrown down this natural
curiosity, should superintend the putting it up again.
The terms were accepted, and thirteen capstans, with
blocks, chains, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> were sent from the dock-yard.</p>

<p>The Editor having commenced a contribution of money
with twenty-five pounds, raised it to a hundred and fifty;
and on the <abbr title="second">2d</abbr> of November, in the presence of thousands,
amidst ladies waving their handkerchiefs, men firing <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feux-de-joye</i>,
and universal shouts, Mr. Goldsmith had the satisfaction
and the glory of replacing this immense rock in its
natural position, uninjured in its discriminating properties.</p>

<p>In consequence of the Editor making a second application
to the Admiralty, and of his commencing another contribution
of money with five pounds, Lanyon Cromlech
was also replaced by the same apparatus.</p>

<p>The walk of about a mile and a half along the cliffs from
Trereen Dinas to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Levan Church, is grand and romantic
in the highest degree. Between the two points is
inclosed Porth Kernow, where the water is beautifully
transparent, over a fine sand composed in part of minute
shells quite entire, and of various species and genera, to be
collected on the beach. The church itself is in a most sequestered
spot, and said by Mr. Tonkin to be dedicated to
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Levina, who was a British female, and suffered martyrdom
<!--037.png--><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pageno">33</span>
under the Saxons before their conversion to the Christian
faith.</p>

<p>The relics of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Levine or Lewine were long preserved
and honoured at Seaford, about ten miles from Eastbourn
in Sussex, till, in 1058, eight years before the Norman Conquest,
her remains, together with those of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Idaberga,
another female, and a portion of the relics of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Oswald,
were carried beyond the seas, and deposited in the abbey
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Winock at Bergh in Flanders, amidst a variety of
miracles attested by Drogo, an eye-witness, and published
in the great collection of the Bollandists.</p>

<p>The only object worthy of attention in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Levan
church is a plain monument to Miss Thomasin Dennis,
with the following inscription:</p>

<p class="center" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thomasin Dennis,<br />
de Trembath,<br />
ingenio, suavitate, virtute<br />

erepta<br />
obiit <abbr title="30">xxx</abbr> die Augusti 1809,<br />
anno ætatis <abbr title="38">xxxviii</abbr>.</p>

<p>Miss Dennis was born at Sawah in this parish, the
daughter of Mr. Alexander Dennis, one of the superior
class of farmers, who occupy their own estates held at quit-rents
for lives. He afterwards removed to Trembath in
Maddern. Her superior genius displayed itself at a very
early age, in reciting poetry from our best authors, and
then in producing imitations of her own. “She lisped in
numbers from her mother’s arms.” French was acquired
with equal accuracy and facility; and then, observing that
her eldest brother appeared to make an inadequate progress
<!--038.png--><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="pageno">34</span>
in Latin, occasioned by the entire want of attention
on the part of the schoolmaster at Penzance, this young
lady under eighteen studied a classic language for the mere
purpose of helping forward her brother.</p>

<p>The celebrity which Miss Dennis had now acquired,
brought her acquainted with the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Hitchins, the
learned vicar of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hilary, with the Editor of this work,
and with several others, more or less scholars, from all of
whom she received the praises due to her superior talents,
and such instruction or assistance as they could afford, by
lending books, or by indicating the most approved methods
of proceeding; and with such slender help her progress
was so great and almost unexampled, that not only were
all the Roman authors soon read, but the Greek writers
followed in a rapid succession, till Æschylus and Pindar
became her familiar acquaintance.</p>

<p>About this time Miss Dennis was induced to accompany
Mr. and Mrs. Josiah Wedgewood from Penzance, chiefly
as a friend and a visitor, but partly also, in return for their
civilities and kindness, to overlook the progress of their
son; but her health began to fail, her only sister fell into a
consumption, she returned to nurse her, and died of the
same most pitiable complaint.</p>

<p class="center">Εν Μακαρεσσι πονων ανταξιος ειη Αμοιβη.</p>

<p>Nothing of her poetry has been given to the public; nor
would it now be fair to print a few trifles. Miss Dennis
proved herself adequate to the composition of any work in
prose, by publishing in 1806, at Mr. Johnson’s in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Paul’s Churchyard, “Sophia <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clare,” in name indeed a
novel, but far superior in style of writing and in correctness
of sentiment, to the fictions of the day. From the
want of incident, however, similar to those which are characterized
in the drama by producing stage effect, the
work failed of becoming popular.</p>

<p>This parish, after Trereen Dinas, is distinguished by
<!--039.png--><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><span class="pageno">35</span>
the possession of Tol-Peder-Penwith, about a mile westward
from the church, the approach to which lies under
romantic cliffs, and crosses a short deep vale, where
boats are sheltered in a small cove apparently inaccessible
to human art or daring. At the very extremity of
the point an excavation has been made by the sea, of some
portion less compacted than the remainder of the rock,
probably of a lode, which opens to the surface in the
form of an inverted cone. This place is very dangerous of
access, on account of the steep descent covered by a slippery
turf; but strangers are tempted to risk their lives in
approaching the abyss, by the dashing of the waves within
it, and by the tremendous roar of the sea. Two gentlemen
from London were induced to enter the cavern leading
from the sea, and were surrounded by the tide. One, who
excelled in swimming, fortunately got out and communicated
the perilous situation of his companion to a neighbouring
farmer, who hastened with assistance and with
ropes to the spot, and succeeded in lifting him to the surface
through the cone. Nor must the circumstance be
omitted, that, although the stranger was possessed of a very
large fortune, he could not prevail on his rescuer to accept
of the least pecuniary reward for preserving the life of a
fellow-creature.</p>

<p>The villages in this parish are of small importance.
Bosistow belonged in remote times to a family of the same
name, giving for their arms Azure, three escallops Vaire.
Mr. Bosistow, now residing at Tredreath in Lelant, is
believed to represent this ancient family. In more recent
times Bosistow belonged to the Davieses.</p>

<p>All the farms in this parish have been constantly occupied
either by the freeholders or by persons possessing
leaseholds, paying quit-rents, for lives; in consequence,
they have taken extreme care against making parishioners,
and in managing their Poor Rate, as will appear from its
small amount.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DOCTOR BOASE.</p>

<p>This parish is entirely situated on granite, which in
many places furnishes a good and fertile soil, as has been
observed in the adjoining parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Burian. Its fine
sea cliffs exhibit many varieties of the granite, and distinctly
show the manner of arrangement in the more common
and larger masses. To enter on the details of this
subject, would occupy too much space. The geologist will
find ample amusement along the whole line of these cliffs,
which are always viewed by the romantic tourist with great
delight. Besides the elevation and grand contour of the
cliffs, here will be found the celebrated Logan Rock at
Trereen, and the Tunnel Rock at Tol-Peder-Penwith.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>It may be observed, that I have always used the words
Log-ing Rock, for the celebrated stone at Trereen Dinas.
Much learned research seems to have been idly expended
on the supposed name, “Logan Rock.” To log, is a verb
in general use throughout Cornwall, for vibrating or rolling
like a drunken man; and <em>an</em> is frequently heard in provincial
pronunciation for <em>ing</em>, characteristic of the modern
present participle. The Loging Rock is therefore strictly
descriptive of its peculiar motion.</p>

<p>This is but a poor parish, and hath not many noted
places in it. The most considerable is the manor of Trelask,
Trelask, that is the burnt town, from such an accident
I suppose happening there.</p>

<p>I take this to be the most ancient seat of the Lowers in this
county; who in the last century were a flourishing family,
divided into several branches, though now the females have
carried off the estates into other families, and there are
very few of the males remaining.</p>

<p>On the death of Edward Roper, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> this manor fell to
&mdash;&mdash; Plowden, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> descended from the famous lawyer of
that name, who is the present lord of it.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The parish church is distinguished by some remains of
Gothic ornaments, and by its lofty tower. Within the
church are some recent monuments to the Archers of Trelask,
<!--042.png--><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span class="pageno">38</span>
and one to the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> W. A. Morgan, the late vicar.
There are also several ancient monuments, but greatly defaced.</p>

<p>The villages in this parish are small, and the houses are
generally constructed of the least durable materials. The
principal are Hick’s Mill, Pollyfont, Trenhorne, and Trevadlack.</p>

<p>The manor of Trelaske, having originally belonged to
a family of the same name, came to the Uptons. It is
stated by Mr. Lysons that two co-heiresses of the Upton
family married two brothers of the Lowers, between whom
the property was divided. One half passed to the family
of Plowden; and the other half was sold by Thomas
Lower, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who died in 1703, to John Addis, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> whose
son purchased the share of William Plowden and others.
In 1741, William Addis, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> bequeathed the whole to
Nicholas Swete Archer, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> in whose collateral heirs it
still remains. Trelaske is a handsome gentleman’s seat,
and surrounded by extensive woods. Mr. Nicholas Swete
Archer married a sister of the late Mr. Francis Basset,
of Tehidy, and resided chiefly at Truro in a house the
property of Mr. Enys, of Enys, who had married another
sister of Mr. Francis Basset; this gentleman dying without
children, left Trelaske to his nephew, whose son greatly
improved the house and the place; but has recently been
taken out of this life at an early age, leaving a numerous
family amply provided with the gifts of fortune, and consoled
by the recollection of a parent universally respected
and esteemed.</p>

<p>The manor of Tinney Hall belonged to the family of
Beaumont; the last possessor of that name, Mrs. Dorothy
Beaumont, bequeathed it to her nephew Mr. John Speccot,
of Penheal, from whom it passed to his relation Mr.
Thomas Long (see Egloskerry), and the manor now belongs
to his heir-at-law the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Charles Sweet.</p>

<p>The etymology given by Mr. Tonkin for Trelaske does
not seem to be very probable. The verb Losgi is in
<!--043.png--><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><span class="pageno">39</span>
Cornish to burn; but it does not approach nearly to the
sound of laske, and the derivation has not any support
from tradition at this place, nor in Cubert, nor in Pelynt,
where the name occurs.</p>

<p>The manor of Pollyfont was heretofore a parcel of the
priory of Minster near Botreaux Castle<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span>
, and has been
annexed to the rectory of Minster parish. Some remains
of a chapel are still to be seen at this place.</p>

<p>The great tithes belonged to the family of Gedy or
Giddy, of Trebersey, from whom they descended to Mr.
John Eliot, heir-at-law of the celebrated patriot Sir John
Eliot, who married the heiress of that family; and they
were by him devised, with the whole of his property, to
Mr. William Eliot, second brother of Lord Eliot, of Port
Eliot, now Lord <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Germans, who has parted with them to
Mr. William Hocker, of Trewanta in this parish.</p>

and Lawhitton, to the east the river Tamar, to the south
Stoke Climsland.</p>

<p>Lezant is an abbreviation of Lansant, the Holy Church,
and so it is written in the Taxatio Beneficiorum; so called,
perhaps, as being dedicated to All the Saints: so that
Lezant may signify the same as All Hallows.</p>

<p>It is a rectory, valued in the King’s Books at £32. The
patron is the Bishop of Exeter. The incumbent is the
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. John Grant, Rector likewise of Ruan Lanyhorne,
Canon of Exeter, and son-in-law to the present
Bishop, Dr. Stephen Weston.</p>

<p>The first place of note that offers itself in this parish, is
the manor of Trecarell, which gave name to an eminent
family, seated here (as it is said) before the Norman Conquest,
who gave for their arms, Ermine, two chevrons Sable.</p>

<p>Next, Landew, the black inclosure; aptly enough (in
my opinion) so called, as being under a dismal hill.</p>

<p>This place was for several descents the seat of a younger
branch of the family of Trefusis: the last of which, Nicholas
Trefusis, of this place, was chosen Knight for this
county in Parliament, to succeed Sir Bevil Granville, as
Mr. Hugh Boscawen, of Tregothnan, was to succeed Sir
Alexander Carew; both which knights fell for the King’s
cause in 1643 and 1644, the first by the sword, at the
battle of Lansdowne, the other by the axe, on Tower Hill.
The said Nicholas Trefusis had by his wife two daughters
<!--045.png--><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><span class="pageno">41</span>
and coheirs: Mary, married in her father’s lifetime to
Edward Herle, of Prideaux, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> and Catherine, married
after his death to Richard Kelliow, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr></p>

<p>Mr. Trefusis, by his will, bearing date August 13, 1647,
settled (inter alia) this barton, with its appurtenances,
called his barton and demesnes of Landew and Dinham’s
land, with the Almes Pool Meadow, and Greston Moor,
on the said Mr. Herle and Mary his wife, and their heirs
for ever.</p>

<p>Mr. Herle settled in this place his eldest son, who new-built
the house here, but did not live to finish it, for he
died in his father’s lifetime, leaving by his wife two sons,
Edward and Nicholas, and several daughters.</p>

<p>Edward Herle, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> seated himself and family here, was
Sheriff of Cornwall in the 12th year of Ann, 1713; and
was a Member in the last Parliament for the town of
Launceston. A gentleman of bright parts, a lovely aspect,
and admired and esteemed by all that had the happiness to
know him,&mdash;I may say by all that ever heard of his name and

to the hundred of East, in the valuation of Pope Nicholas,
under the name Ecclesia de Sacre, and valued at £5.</p>

to have been a place of considerable consequence. The
last of the original family bearing the same name, was living
there in the year 1540, when, having lost his only son,
Sir Henry Trecarrell built the beautiful church at Launceston.
On this gentleman’s decease, the property became
divided among his three daughters; but at the period of
the Civil Wars Trecarrell had passed into other hands,
and Mr. Maneton, then proprietor, entertained King
Charles the First, on the 1st day of August 1644, previously
to his proceeding to Leskeard, and from thence to
the surrender of the army commanded by Lord Essex.
Mr. Maneton died in 1654, since which time it has ceased
to be a mansion. The property is now vested in Sir Thomas
Acland, and Mr. Geake who resides on the place, where
some portions of the ancient building are still to be seen,
especially the remains of a hall, and of a chapel dedicated
to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary Magdalen.</p>

<p>Landew also bestowed a name on its ancient proprietors,
or received it from them; two of whom occur in the
list of Members returned to Parliament for Launceston.</p>

<p>Mr. Tonkin has mentioned the early death of Mr. Northmore
Herle: this gentleman devised Landew to one of his
half-sisters, daughter of Dr. Kendall, from whom it descended
to the late Mr. Humphry Lawrence, of Launceston,
who sold it to Mr. William Bant. But the place has
been sold again, and is now the residence of John Thomas
Phillipps, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> representative, with Mr. Carpenter of
Mount Tavy, of the Phillippses of Newport and Camelford.</p>

<p>Landew had formerly a chapel dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bridget;
and there was a third in the parish, dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Lawrence.</p>

<p>Carthamartha, a part of the great manor of Lawhitton,

<p class="p2 center smaller unindent">THE MANOR OF CARNEDON PRIOR.&mdash;THE ROCKY HILL.</p>

<p>In Domesday Book is a manor called Carneten, which I
believe to be this. And if so, it was one of the manors
given by William the Conqueror to Robert Earl of Morton,
when he made him Earl of Cornwall.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The manors of Millaton and Carnadon Prior belong to
the Duchy of Cornwall; the latter had belonged to the
Priory of Launceston, and is one of the manors given in exchange
by King Henry the Eighth for the honour of Wallingford.</p>

<p>On the waste of this manor stands the lofty hill usually
called Carraton Downs, supposed, with the exception of
Brown Willy (which is elevated 1368 feet above the sea)
to be the highest land in Cornwall. Here King Charles
the First drew up his forces on the <abbr title="second">2d</abbr> of August, 1644, and
was joined by Prince Maurice.</p>

<p>The manor of Trefrize or Trefy is said to have belonged,
at a remote period, to the family of Trefey. It belonged to
Sir Henry Trecarrell, of Trecarrell, in Lezant, and became
split among his daughters. It is now again united in the
family of Vyvyan, of Trelowarren. Some accounts represent
<!--049.png--><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><span class="pageno">45</span>
this place as having been very magnificent, and the residence
of a Lord (qu. Laird?) Trefey.</p>

<p>In this parish are several elevated points of land covered
with granite or other crystaline rocks in the most magnificent
groups, and commanding extensive prospects, first over
this rugged ground, then across the Tamar, and its fertile
vale, with Hamoaze, Plymouth, and the Sound, having
the whole bounded by the mountains of Dartmoor.</p>

<p>Among the most remarkable of those points or carnes are
Sharp or Sharpy Tor, the Cheese Wring, and the Hurlers.
But for a minute and accurate description of the
whole district, the Editor would again refer, as he has done
under <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clair, to “Topographical and Historical Sketches
of the Borough of East and West Looe, and of the neighbourhood.
By Thomas Bond, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> 1 <abbr title="volume octavo">vol. 8vo.</abbr> 1823, printed
for J. Nichols and Son, Parliament Street, Westminster.”</p>

<p>The church having fallen into decay was rebuilt by the
munificent founder of Launceston Church, Sir Henry Trecarrell:
it contains several monuments.</p>

<p>At the Taxation of Pope Nicholas, in 1291, this church
is valued at £7 a year, having never been appropriated;
and it is there called Ecclesia de Ludewon.</p>

<p>The chief place in this parish, on which stands the
church, is the manor of Ludgian Lease, that is, Ludgian
place, or inclosed land. In Domesday Book it is called
Ludaham, being one of the manors given by William the
Conqueror to his half-brother, Robert Earl of Morton.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The manor of Ludgean Lease has been of great consequence
and extent. It still spreads over lands in several
parishes; and holds as appendages the advowson to the
rectory of this parish, and the high lordship of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives,
where certain honorary perquisites are paid to the lord of
this manor for ships entering the port; and moreover, on
the day of holding the annual court, the corporation maces
are borne before the steward. Mr. Lysons states that the
<!--051.png--><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><span class="pageno">47</span>
manor was given by Richard Earl of Cornwall to the
family of Ferrers; from whom it passed, by successive
female heirs, to those of Champernown and Willoughby
(Lord Broke), and from a coheiress of the latter to the
family of Paulet; and it now belongs to the two daughters,
or their descendants, of Henry Paulet, last Duke of Bolton,
who died in 1794.</p>

<p>Treassow has been for a considerable time the seat of
the family of Rogers, since removed to Penrose, in the
neighbourhood of Helston, in consequence of a large fortune
acquired there by Mr. John Rogers, as steward to the
Godolphins.</p>

<p>Annexed to Treassow is Castle-an-Dinas, the most lofty
hill in that whole district, and the one standing furthest
towards the south. It differs, however, from all the other
hills thereabout in the quality of its material; for, although
the whole is granite, not a rock is to be seen, and at its
north-western base works are carried on, similar to those
near <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell for preparing china-clay. On the top of
the hill a considerable part remains of the extensive dinas,
entrenchment, or castle, that has given the name, reduplicated
in modern times, from an entire forgetfulness of the
Celtic language.</p>

<p>Borlase gives the following description of these remains:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Castle-an-Dinas consisted of two stone walls, one
within the other, in a circular form, surrounding the
area of the hill. The ruins are now fallen on each
side of the walls, and show the work to have been
of great height and thickness. There was also a
third, or outer wall, built more than halfway round.
Within the walls are many little inclosures of a circular
form, about seven yards diameter, with little walls round
them of two or three feet high; they appear to have been
so many huts for the shelter of the garrison. The diameter
of the whole fort from east to west is four hundred
feet, and the principal ditch sixty feet. Towards the
south, the sides of the hill are marked by two large
<!--052.png--><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><span class="pageno">48</span>
green paths, about ten feet wide. Near the middle of the
area is a well, almost choked up with its own ruins, and at
a little distance a narrow pit, its sides walled round, probably
for water also, now filled up.”</p>

<p>On this account the following remarks have been made
by a recent intelligent writer:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span>
</p>

<p class="blockquote">“It is to be regretted that Borlase did not publish a
plan to illustrate his description of this Castle, as it has
been much dilapidated since his time. A tower was built
on the site of the outer wall about forty years ago, by Mr.
Rogers, of Penrose; and subsequent reparations have
not contributed towards a restoration of the old walls.
Nor are there any perceptible remains of the inclosures,
two or three feet high, which formed the huts for the
shelter of the garrison; but in this respect, Borlase’s
description exactly corresponds with the remains I observed
within the area of Chûn-Castle, as already mentioned.
I could discover no traces of the ancient entrance,
nor does Borlase notice it; if it was towards the
west, as at Chûn-Castle, it has been blocked up, for the
walls on that side seem to have been rebuilt or repaired;
if on the southern side, where, Borlase says, there were
two broad paths leading up the side of the hill, towards
the Castle, it has been totally destroyed.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“I now proceed to a description of this ancient and
curious fortress. The first inclosure is a mound of earth
alone, seven or eight feet high, surrounded by a ditch.
Within this, a second fosse, or ditch, encircled the <em>outer
wall</em>, which was built as before described, and is about
five feet in thickness, and four or five high, excepting
towards the south-east, where it has been destroyed, and
<!--053.png--><a name="Page_47a" id="Page_47a"></a><span class="pageno">47a</span>
the materials used in building the tower before mentioned.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“A vallum, or terrace, separates this wall from another
of considerable strength and thickness, being thirteen
feet across at the top. The circular area inclosed by this
wall is two hundred and fifty-four feet in diameter. A
third wall, of no great substance or height, like the others,
appears to have made a circuit within this space, and reduced
the diameter to one hundred and ninety feet. But
what is most curious in this Castle, is the appearance of a
certain wavy outline, slightly raised above the natural soil,
but overgrown with turf. The singular form of these
foundations, if they are supposed to be the inclosures
noticed by Borlase, and their exact regularity, which I
took some pains to ascertain, is perhaps deserving the
attention of some more experienced antiquary.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The area within is very uneven, and has, nearly in the
centre, a small round inclosure, twenty-two feet in diameter,
without an entrance. It is exactly similar in its
construction to the remains in Caër-Brane and Bartìnè
Castles. There is a well also within the circuit of the
walls, and we were told it was never known to be without
water. The diameter of the whole work, from ditch to
ditch, north and south, is four hundred and thirty-six feet.”</p>

<p>Rosevithney was for ages a gentleman’s residence. The
family of Larmer possessed it during a considerable time,
till it passed by an heiress to a branch of the Davieses.
The freehold has recently been sold three or four times.</p>

<p>Trowell, an adjoining farm, which belonged to the Godolphins,
is remarkable for the extremely productive copper-mine,
called Whele Fortune, which first launched Mr.
Lemon on his splendid voyage through life.</p>

<p>The name of another farm in Ludgean, which cannot be
accidental, requires notice. On this farm was a well, now
destroyed by mines, having, in all probability, some slight
quality of a chalybeate. The water acquired an established
reputation for the relief of weak sight, and hundreds repaired
<!--054.png--><a name="Page_48a" id="Page_48a"></a><span class="pageno">48a</span>
there every year to bathe their eyes. The farm is
named Collurian, and has been so time out of mind.</p>

<p>Varfull has been held as a leasehold for lives, or under
copy of court roll, for more than a century, by the family of
Davy, and actually belonged to Sir Humphry Davy, whose
name has reflected so much honour, not on Cornwall alone,
but on the whole nation to which he belonged.</p>

<p>The church, with the church town and the rectory, are
placed in a commanding situation, and being surrounded
by trees, make one of the most pleasing objects in the
Mount’s Bay. The house has been entirely rebuilt by
the late rector Mr. John Stephens. The tower is one of
the most correct in its proportions and in its ornaments of
any in the west of Cornwall. About the year 1761, a pinnacle
was thrown down by lightning, and the effect was
then universally imputed to the vengeance of a perturbed
spirit exorcised from Treassow, and passing eastward towards
the usual place of banishment in the Red Sea.</p>

<p>A more ancient legend is also connected with this church.
After <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ludgvan, an Irish missionary, if such a one ever
existed, had constructed the fabric, he brought a stream of
water under the church stile, with the intention of bestowing
on the water various miraculous powers; among others,
that of enabling every infant sprinkled with it at the baptismal
font, instantly to acquire the power of making all
the responses in distinct words, and probably in the Latin
tongue; but, being interrupted by some unhallowed interference,
his general purposes were defeated, so that one alone
of the many intended qualities could by possibility be conferred;
a qaality very different from the former, but so
much esteemed by some descriptions of persons, that, within
times of memory, children are reported to have been
brought there for baptism, to acquire the protection afforded
by this consecrated stream, which, after washing
away the stain of original sin, does not indeed effectually
guard the infant against committing crimes of his own, but
against ever expiating them through the medium of an
<!--055.png--><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a><span class="pageno">49</span>
hempen cord; and experience is said to have proved that
the charm does not extend to one of silk.</p>

<p>But the church of Ludgvan is not driven to seek renown
from ancient missionaries or from legendary saints: during
fifty years of the eighteenth century, it had for its rector
Dr. William Borlase, a man of whom Cornwall will ever
have reason to be proud.</p>

<p>At a time when the very names of natural science were
scarcely heard among us, and when our mining and metallurgic
processes were matters merely empiric, Dr. Borlase
kindled the first spark of light, and fanned it by long-continued
and able exertions, guided by a correspondence
with persons the most distinguished on the continent
of Europe, as well as at home, with the great Linnæus, and
with Boerhaave, in some departments superior even to
Linnæus himself. When no communications were maintained
by the rapid circulation of periodical journals, antiquities,
as connected with classical acquirements, had
proceeded much further than the sciences dependent on
mathematics and on natural philosophy. Dr. Borlase, in
a most learned work, essayed to trace the learning, the
mythology, and the civil institutions of the Celtic people,
the earliest inhabitants of Britain, and especially of their
priests the Druids; and with such success, that it established
his high reputation for learning, for extensive research,
and for discriminating judgment, throughout the
literary world, where the subject, from its general nature,
excited universal attention. For this work the degree of
Doctor in Civil Law by diploma was conferred on him by
the University of Oxford; an honour bestowed with so
much discrimination and regard to its high value, that the
next instance occurs in the case of Dr. Johnson, about ten
years afterwards.</p>

mensis Martii, anno Domini millessimo septingentessimo
sexagessimo sexto.”</p>

<p>Not having been born sufficiently early even to see this
highly distinguished person, I am induced to copy the following
short notices from a well-known Biographical Dictionary,
with a few trifling alterations:</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William Borlase, <abbr title="Doctor of Laws">LL.D.</abbr> a very ingenious and
learned writer, was of an ancient family in Cornwall, and
born at Pendeen in the parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just, February <abbr title="second">2d</abbr>,
1695-6. His father had represented <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives in Parliament.</p>

<p>Mr. Borlase received the early part of his education at
Penzance, but in 1709 removed to Plymouth. In March
1712-13 he became a member of Exeter College; and in
June 1719, took his degree of Master of Arts. In 1720
he was ordained priest, and in 1722 he received institution
to the rectory of Ludgvan in Cornwall. In 1732 the Lord
Chancellor King presented him to the vicarage of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just,
his native parish, the only preferments he ever obtained.</p>

<p>In the parishes of Ludgvan and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just were at that
time rich mines of copper and of tin, abounding with a
great variety of curious minerals. These he collected, and
<!--058.png--><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><span class="pageno">52</span>
from that pursuit was led to study at large the natural history
of this most interesting county.</p>

<p>The numerous monuments of remote antiquity scattered
over the hills and promontories of Cornwall, made also
deep impressions on his mind, and he availed himself of
every resource placed within his reach, by previous learning
and erudition, to acquire a knowledge of the Druidical
learning, and of the manners and customs of the ancient
Britons previously to their becoming Christians. In 1750
he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1753
published in a folio volume, at Oxford, “The Antiquities
of Cornwall.” A second edition in the same form came
out at London in the year 1769, with considerable additions,
under the following title: “Antiquities, Historical
and Monumental, of the County of Cornwall, consisting of
several Essays on the ancient Inhabitants, Druid Superstition,
Customs, and Remains of the most remote Antiquity
in Britain and the British Isles; exemplified and proved
by Monuments now extant in Cornwall and the Scilly Islands:
with a Vocabulary of the Cornu-British language.
Revised, with several additions, by the Author.”</p>

<p>His next publication had for its title, “Observations on
the ancient and present state of the Islands of Scilly, and
their importance to the Trade of Great Britain,” Oxford,
1756, <abbr title="quarto">4to</abbr>. This work was an extension of a paper, read
before the Royal Society in 1753.</p>

<p>In 1758 came out his “Natural History of Cornwall,
with Engravings of all the specimens, both animate and
mineral, deemed to be of curiosity or of importance,”
printed also at Oxford, in one volume folio, the original
specimens and many antiquities being deposited in the
Ashmolean Museum.</p>

<p>All these works, executed with great ability, patient diligence,
and skill, raised the reputation of the author so
high throughout the learned world, that in March 1766,
the University of Oxford conferred on him their highest
honour, the degree of Doctor by diploma, which he lived to
<!--059.png--><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><span class="pageno">53</span>
enjoy somewhat more than six years, having departed this
life on the 31st of August, 1772.</p>

<p>Besides his literary correspondence with various learned
men, he carried on one of peculiar frequency with the
great poet of his age, Mr. Alexander Pope, and a large
collection of Mr. Pope’s letters to him is still extant, with
a variety of other papers, obviously intended for publication.</p>

<p>Dr. Borlase furnished Mr. Pope with many Cornish fossils
to decorate his celebrated grotto at Twickenham, where
the donor’s name was scored in capitals of the most splendid
materials; and in a letter written on the occasion, Mr.
Pope says, “I am much obliged to you for your valuable
collection of Cornish diamonds. I have placed them where
they may best represent yourself, in a shade, but shining.”</p>

<p>The Royal Society is indebted to Dr. Borlase for about
twenty different communications, and in addition to all
these labours, he for several years undertook the care of
some private pupils, and had together under his roof the
heirs of the principal families in the neighbourhood, Hawkins,
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn, and Vyvyan.</p>

<p>A plain stone has been laid over his remains in Ludgven
Church, with an inscription rendered almost illegible in
the short period of sixty years.</p>

<p>The monument of some distinguished person bears an
inscription ending with these words:</p>

<p class="center" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Commemorat hæc tabula<br />
brevi et ipsa interitura.</p>

<p>But we may console ourselves with a better reflection,<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Ανδρων γαρ επιφανων πασα Γη Ταφος, και ου Στηλων μονον
εν τῃ οικειᾳ σημαινει επιγραφη, αλλα και εν τῃ μη προσηκουσῃ
αγραφος μνημη παρ’ εκαστῳ της γνωμης μαλλον η του εργου ενδιαιταται.</p>

<p>Dr. William Borlase left two sons, one a Fellow of All
Souls College, and subsequently presented to the University
<!--060.png--><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><span class="pageno">54</span>
living of South Tetherwin near Launceston. He married
Miss Alice Dewen of Marazion, but died without a
family.</p>

<p>The other son was rector of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mewan, and his grandson
is now in possession of the family estates, not one of
the numerous sons of Dr. Walter Borlase having left a
male heir.</p>

<p>Since the decease of Dr. William Borlase, two permanent
rectors have alone held the church up to the last year
1834, Mr. Herbert Praed, second son of Mr. Humphry
Mackworth Praed of Trevethow, and Mr. John Stephens of
Tregenna; but their relative situations, in regard to the individuals
possessing the right of presentation, have induced
many to conjecture that this power may have been exercised
from considerations not strictly conformable to those
in contemplation when advowsons were entrusted to private
hands. Mr. Stephens is succeeded by the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Henry
Elliot Graham; a relation or connection of the gentleman
now representing the Powlet family.</p>

<p>The chief proprietor of land in this parish is the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
John Rogers of Penrose, canon residentiary of Exeter.
Mr. Gregar of Trewarthenick has also some farms; and as
leasehold proprietors, the family of Curnow have been
ancient residents.</p>

<p>The parish feast is kept on the nearest Sunday to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Paul’s Day, January 25.</p>

<p>This parish measures 3941 statute acres.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>The northern corner of this parish is situated on granite,
resembling that of Gulval in every respect, except as
<!--061.png--><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a><span class="pageno">55</span>
to one variety abounding in mica. Much of this stone
may be seen in the more ancient houses at Penzance. The
spot, however, from whence this stone was procured, is no
longer known. A difference of opinion is indeed entertained
as to whether it was gotten from blocks near the
surface, or from a bed that has been exhausted; but all
are agreed as to the district from whence it came; and it is
universally known by the name of Ludgvan stone. The
property of cleaving evenly into regular blocks, eminently
possessed by this species of granite, makes it valuable for
building purposes; and this property is clearly derived
from the even arrangement of the <a name="err_2" id="err_2"></a>scale of mica in which it
abounds.</p>

<p>Between the granite and the sea-shore a considerable
portion of the schistose rocks is covered by a marsh, and by
banks of sand. These rocks are made up of compact felspar,
sometimes nearly pure, at others intimately united
with hornblend or actynolite; they are traversed by courses
or dykes of felspar porphyry, as may be seen on the sea-shore.</p>

<p>The right name of this parish is Lan Julian, the church
of Saint Julian; but although the church was originally
dedicated to him, it has since changed its patron, and belongs
to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ayre.</p>

patronage in Sir Nicholas Trevanion and Mrs. Carverth,
now married to Mr. Cole, the present incumbent, whose
father was incumbent before him. This church was valued,
if at all in the taxation of Pope Nicholas, together with
that of Lanlivery, both being then appropriated to the
priory of Tywardreth.</p>

<p>I shall begin with the principal as well as the most
westerly estate in it,</p>

<p class="p2 center smaller unindent">THE MANOR OF PRIDEAUX.</p>

<p>This some would derive from a French original, as being
pres d’eaux, near the waters; for that the sea formerly
flowed up as high as this place, till the stream works
choaked up its entrance, any one that views the high cliffs
under this place, and those on the opposite side of the valley
in Tywardreath, must needs be convinced of. And
this leads me to another etymology for it, and as suitable
to its situation, from Pir or Prid, clay, and Aus, the same
with Als, the cliff or sea-shore.</p>

<p>But be this how it will, Prideaux Castle herein was for
several ages (probably before the Norman Conquest) the
seat of, and gave name to a family which hath been very
eminent both in this county and in Devonshire, and still
flourisheth in both. Thomas de Prideaux represented this
county in the Parliament 26 Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> and Roger de Prideaux
was Sheriff of Cornwall 15 Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> His father
Dominus Thomas Prideaux de Prideaux, was one of those
who had in the 25th of Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 20<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per annum or more,
in lands or rents in this county, which he held by knight’s
service. This family gave for their arms, Party per pale
Azure and Gules, three castles Counterchanged; which
arms are now quartered by Mr. Prideaux of Padstow, who
is descended, as well as all of the name, from younger
branches of the family residing here.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.

<p>There does not seem to be any thing connected with the
remaining property of this parish that is important or curious.
The chief landholders are the Rashleigh family,
and Mrs. Agar, representative of the Robertses.</p>

<p>Mr. Coleman Rashleigh, son of Mr. John Rashleigh of
Penquite, a younger brother from Menabilly, has purchased
Prideaux, built there an excellent modern house,
and restored the place, although in a different style, to its
ancient splendour. This gentleman has distinguished himself
as one of the most active, most able, and most energetic
among those who have supported in Cornwall the theories
leading to recent organic change in the system of our representation,
and he has been created a Baronet by the Reform
administration.</p>

<p>The church is situated on very lofty ground, amidst granite
rocks, so universally scattered over the surface, that many
houses are built in such a manner as to make one or more of
these rocks available in the walls. Yet the soil is good; and
Mr. Grylls, the present vicar, has proved that taste and perseverance
may create an elegant assemblage of whatever is
useful or ornamental in a situation apparently the most
unpromising. The tower as well as the church far exceed
the average in size and beauty. The tower has a singular
addition of a small room at the top; and in this room various
records relating to the Stannaries and to the Duchy
of Cornwall are said to have been preserved, while the
armies on both sides, in the civil war, were ravaging the
country, and destroying the towns.</p>

<p>Mr. Tonkin has remarked on the romantic and beautiful
vale which descends from Luxilian Church by Prideaux
to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Blazey Bridge, and in explaining the phenomena of
lofty and precipitous inland cliffs, he has anticipated the
most recent theories of modern geology. See Principles of
Geology, by Charles Lyell.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>This parish stretches north and south across the large
patch of granite, which is situated between Bodmin and
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell, and also extends over the slate at its northern
and southern extremities. The extent of surface covered
by the northern slate is more than a square mile; but the
southern slate forms only a small triangle north and north-east
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Blazey Bridge. The northern half of this parish
corresponds with the parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dennis in the nature
of its rocks; the southern half with <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Blazey. The most interesting feature of this parish, in a
geological point of view, consists of its numerous and extensive
stream-works. This part of Cornwall, including
the adjoining parishes, has long been celebrated for the
fine quality of its stream-tin, which is, as to the greater
part, either crystalline, or of the kind denominated wood-tin,
on account of its fibrous texture. The gravel containing
this stream-tin rests on the rock, or on its untransported
debris; above this occurs a regular stratum of decayed
trees and plants; in the deepest stream-works these
are covered by another bed of gravel containing tin, having
also a superincumbent layer of decayed trees and
plants: but this second stratum of tin, always less in quantity
than the first, is seldom of sufficient value to pay for
the labour of separation. Over all occurs a layer of uncertain
thickness, composed of the debris of adjacent rocks,
and sustaining on its surface a coating of recent vegetable,
and forming marshy, arable, or meadow land, according to
the accidental situation of the spot.</p>

<p>The greater part of the valleys in Cornwall having been
long since streamed, exhibit little else than heaps of unsightly
rubbish; instead of displaying, as in other districts,
the most pleasing features of a country. The late Mr.
Humphrey Mackworth Praed has, however, proved in the
case of a valley at Lelant, that such deformities may be
removed, and the meadows restored to their natural beauty,
accompanied even by pecuniary advantage to the proprietor.
But such improvements are greatly obstructed by
an anomalous property called the right of bounds.</p>

<p>Mabe, a vicarage, is situated in the hundred of Kerryer,
and hath upon the north Stithians, and west Constantine;
east, part of Gluvias and Bradock.</p>

<p>For the name, it is plain Cornish Mab or Mabe, being a
son, and in this place either to be construed in reference to
Milorus (son of Melianus, King or Duke of Cornwall),
who lies buried in Milor church-yard, and who was
lord of this place, or had some jurisdiction over it, as
Milor church at this day hath in spirituals over Mabe, to
which it is considered as annexed.</p>

<p>Or perhaps the name of this church, Mab or Mabe,
refers to our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, to whose
honour it may have been erected by our ancestors as a
pledge of their orthodox faith, in opposition to the Ebiorite
and Arian heresies.</p>

<p>The chief estate in this parish, and which I shall therefore
begin with, is the manor of Carnsew, alias, says Mr.
Carew, Carndew, the black rock, or rather a heap of
black rocks, this parish and estate abounding in great
rocks of moorstone. This place gave name to a very eminent
family, which removed afterwards to Bokelby in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Kew. One of the Carnsews of Bokelby granted a lease of
the barton of Carnsew, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth,
to William Thomas, which William Thomas from thenceforth
took the name of Carnsew; and I have in my possession
a grant of arms from Sir Richard <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George, Clarenceux
King-at-Arms, to Henry Carnsew, of Trewone,
junior, dated the <abbr title="second">2d</abbr> of December 1633, recognising this
assumption of a new name from his place of residence.</p>

<p>This family has since removed to a better settlement at
Trewoon in Budock.</p>

<p>Carverth, which signifies the green town, is also within
and held from this manor. This place gave name to, and
was the seat of an ancient race of gentlemen, from whom it
passed to the Penalunas, till, in the reign of King Charles
the First, it was sold to Thomas Melhuish of Penryn, merchant,
<!--068.png--><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><span class="pageno">62</span>
descended from the Melhuishes of Northan in
Devonshire.</p>

<p>Tremogh, that is, the dwelling or town of hogs, is also
held from this manor, and was likewise formerly the seat of
a family of the same name, from whom it came to the family
of Blois of Penryn, in which name it continued till
the year 1703, when Roger and John Blois, two brothers,
sold this barton, which is of considerable value, to John
Worth, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Penryn, who had for some time before a
considerable mortgage on it.</p>

<p>Mr. Worth hath built on Tremogh a very large house
of moorstone (granite), and hath inclosed a small park for
deer. He hath been a justice of the peace during all the
reign of Queen Anne, King George the First, and King
George the Second; and was sheriff of the county in the
tenth year of Queen Anne. His father, Mr. William
Worth, of Penryn, merchant, married Jane, one of the
daughters and coheiresses of Pennalerick, by whom he
had, among others, a second son, William Worth, <abbr title="Doctor of Divinity">D.D.</abbr>
now Archdeacon of Worcester.</p>

<p>Mr. John Worth hath been some time a widower by the
death of his wife Bridget, daughter of Francis Trefusis, of
Trefusis, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who has left him only one son, of the same

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Mr. Hals has been singularly unfortunate in his etymology
of Tremogh, which has therefore been omitted. Without
all doubt, it means, as Mr. Tonkin has interpreted, the
hog or pig’s town; and the street leading to Tremogh from
Penryn is now called Pig’s Street. The heiress of the
Worth family married an adventurer of the name of Hamilton,
who ruined all his affairs by contested elections and
extravagances. Tremogh was sold about the year 1775; and
<!--069.png--><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a><span class="pageno">63</span>
having passed into the hands of persons of a nearly similar
description, the house remained shut up till the wood decayed,
and the place was disfigured by the sale and removal
of all the trees. The property has, however, at last been
secured by a respectable gentleman, who resides on the
spot, has renovated the house, and commenced planting
and other decorations.</p>

<p>The most discriminating feature of this parish and of
the immediate neighbourhood, is the great abundance of
granite, not merely in large blocks, the proper moorstone,
but in regular and extensive quarries; and so great has
been the exportation of this most valuable material, that
almost the whole of Waterloo Bridge, and much of the
interior of London Bridge, are constructed of stone carried
to the Thames from Falmouth harbour.</p>

<p>Districts abounding in crystalline rocks are usually uneven,
and in this parish the main road, leading from Helston
and all the west to Penryn and Falmouth, had to
descend Mabe-hill; but in this year (1835) the line has
been turned from the south of Tremogh to a vale on the
northern side, which reduces the upper level, and converts
a precipitous descent into one sufficiently sloped for carriages
of every description. The old road has, however, still
an attraction for botanists, as the antirrhinum monspessulanum,
a plant very rarely found in other situations, grows
there abundantly on the banks and hedges.</p>

<p>Mr. Tonkin is mistaken in tracing the family of Tremayne,
long settled at Heligan, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ewe, from the barton
in this parish. That family is unquestionably derived from
Tremayne in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s, on the Helford river.</p>

of a branch from the Godolphins, formerly seated
here. It is large, and occupies a commanding situation,
with a lofty tower, visible to a great extent in all directions.
But nothing has in modern times so much distinguished
this parish as the residence of its learned rector, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
Charles Peters.</p>

<p>Mr. Peters’ reputation for a most profound acquaintance
with oriental literature, is sufficiently established by a controversy
with the mighty man of his time, Doctor William
Warburton; but there is also a traditional history of his
benevolence, of his piety, and of his genuine simplicity, so
interesting that the Editor has most gladly availed himself
of a communication from persons nearly connected with this
great and good man, to insert it here.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Charles Peters, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mabyn, was descended
from a merchant of Antwerp, who fled to England
from the persecution of the Protestants in Germany. His
grandson was a Turkey merchant of Fowey in the time of
Queen Elizabeth: this gentleman was father of the famous
Hugh Peters, and his mother was a Treffry, of Place-house.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The ancestor of Mr. Peters of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mabyn was a royalist.
The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Charles Peters was born on the 1st of
December 1690. In Tregony, at the German school
there, he was taught Latin and Greek, and the first rudiments
of Hebrew. He was afterwards of Exeter College,
Oxford. When first ordained he served the curacy of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Justin Roseland; then was presented with the living of
Boconnock. In 1723 the living of Bralton Clovelly was
given to him, and three years afterwards <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mabyn,
where from that time he chiefly resided, but spent a part of
each year at Bralton, keeping a curate at each. Every
Sunday he entertained a great number of the poorest of his
parishioners; and on Monday the remaining meat was distributed
to them, with bread for each; and thus in succession
he entertained all the poor of the parish; and there
was scarcely any poor rate in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mabyn during his life.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“He spent a large portion of his income in relieving the
<!--074.png--><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><span class="pageno">68</span>
temporal wants of his fellow-creatures, and much of his
time in their spiritual instruction. Besides morning and
evening prayers, he read the Bible daily to his family, and
also daily studied it himself in the original languages.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“When he published his Dissertation on the Book of
Job, and drew on himself the insolence of Warburton, he
bore it with the most perfect Christian charity.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“He had written a vindication of Homer in answer to
Warburton. Before it was published Warburton had become
a Bishop, when, fearing that the faults of the man
might reflect on the sacred order, he abstained from publishing
it, saying, ‘Thou shalt not speak evil of the rulers
of thy people.’ Mr. Peters was of abstemious habits, regular
both in his studies and his exercise, which the natural
delicacy of his constitution required. He never married,
but educated the two eldest sons of his elder brother,
Dr. Joseph Peters, M.D. of Truro, and the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Jonathan
Peters, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clement’s. The latter was bred to the
church at his desire, and continued with him as his curate,
till the living of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clement called the nephew to the
cure of his own church.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Mr. Peters lived to the age of eighty-four, retaining
the full possession of his faculties to the last.”</p>

<p>Extracts from his Meditations in manuscript:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>When speaking of Warburton, he says,</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Let me then
go on with this work which I have begun. Let me beg the
assistance of God, that I may do it in a proper manner, so
as not to return evil for evil, or railing for railing, but to
preserve my temper, and to consider what the Dean has
said, in a cool dispassionate way if possible; or at least to
check my pen so as to say nothing that may misbecome
me either as a Christian or a clergyman.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“As to what relates to Dean Warburton, he has freed
me, I think, from all manner of obligation to say anything
in complaisance; for this, considering the usage he has
given me, would look like stooping to him, and distrusting
the cause I have to plead for. I must keep up my spirits
<!--075.png--><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><span class="pageno">69</span>
then, but beware of transgressing the rules of charity, of
prudence, or of good manners.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“If it be necessary that I should publish the remainder
of the Reply to the author of the Divine Legation, grant,
oh Lord! that I may conduct it with all that decency and
prudence, that strict regard to charity as well as truth,
which may become a Christian and a minister of Christ;
that I may have a constant check upon myself with regard
to every thing that may be either light and ludicrous, or
bitter and sarcastic: if my antagonist has given but too
much into this way of writing, the greater shame to him;
and the greater shame to me if I should not endeavour to
avoid so palpable a fault.”</p>

<p>Under the influence of an opinion, or rather of a prejudice
similar to those of plenary inspiration, and an immaculate
preservation of the text, and unmindful that the
Gospels themselves convey a large portion of their instruction
under the form of allegory or parable, Mr. Peters
maintained the historical authenticity of the book of Job
against Dr. Warburton, who argued in favour of the opposite
and manifestly the correct hypothesis. Yet so accurate
and so extensive were the Hebrew learning and the
general erudition of this profound scholar, that he completely
worsted the most celebrated critic of his age, and
drove him from a sober investigation of facts, of ancient opinions,
or of the peculiar form and nature of moral instruction
used by eastern nations at various and remote periods,
into virulent and personal abuse.</p>

<p>It is curious to observe that the Book of Job has not the
most remote allusion to anything connected with the Jews,
neither to their laws or their ritual, nor to their patriarchs,
or to their leader and legislator.</p>

<p>And it is more curious that in all the writings transmitted
to our time by this extraordinary people, from the
Book of Genesis to the last prophecy antecedent to its
Babylonish captivity, not the slightest reference is made to
a state of future existence; unless the strange narrative
<!--076.png--><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><span class="pageno">70</span>
respecting the Witch of Endor should be deemed an exception,
suspected as it is of interpolation; and at all events
utterly unfitted for announcing, and that too incidentally,
the most important of revealed truths. Previously, moreover,
to the captivity, no personification is ever mentioned
of the Principle of Evil.&mdash;“Now the serpent was more subtile
than any beast of the field, which the Lord God had
made; and he said unto the woman,” <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> No allusion is here
made to any supernatural being; nor did the serpent lose
the disgraceful credit till three thousand five hundred years
after the fact, of having by his own unassisted subtilty, malevolence,
and craft, led our first parents into the fatal
snare predestined to work the utter and eternal destruction
of countless millions of the human race, but for the
stupendous mystery of their subsequent redemption.</p>

<p>In the Book of Job reference is made to a future life; and
the Principle of Evil not only appears as a distinct personage,
but is placed in collision and in debate with the Principle
of all Good, driving the Divinity itself to the clumsy
expedient, suited only to the imperfections of a finite intellect,
of ascertaining by an actual experiment, whether a
man were capable of sustaining certain degrees of bodily
pain and of mental affliction, without murmuring against
his Creator, the Lord and Giver of life, in whom we live,
and move, and have our being.</p>

<p>It seems plain, therefore, from the doctrine of a future
state first noticed in this work, from the first introduction
of a being hostile to the happiness of all others and delighting
in their misery, and from the absence of any allusion to
a single fact connected with the Mosaic dispensation, or to
the history embodied in the Sacred Records; and, lastly,
from the dramatic form of the whole; that the Book of
Job must be a parable, a moral tale, a poem wholly unconnected
with the Jewish faith. It seems not to be improbable
that such a composition, teaching the important duties of
resignation and submission to the Divine will,</p>

character, for no copy is said to exist in the ancient or Samaritan
alphabet. And a work so excellent, so abounding
in the most sublime and elevated flights of eastern poetry,
soaring towards such topics as even that poetry is unable fully
to reach, may well have been added by Ezra to the Book of
the Law which he brought before the congregation, and
read before them in the street, when they bowed their
heads, and worshipped the Lord with their faces to the
ground.</p>

<p>The Editor has also been desirous of obtaining information
respecting another member of this family, whom, at
the distance of almost two centuries from those times of violence
and of civil commotion in which he lived, we may
now consider as one persecuted in his death and in his
fame, far beyond the degree which any demerit on his part,
either as a fanatic in religion or as a partizan in politics,
could have justly merited.</p>

<p>He was probably selected as a victim by his opponents to
gratify the base passions of an ignorant multitude, now
anxious to destroy those whom they had previously adored;
and ridicule was cast on his memory by the triumphant
party, as an expedient for beating down religious opinions
hostile to the system of ecclesiastical government then reestablished:
perhaps also, the possession of Lambeth Palace,
like that of the house adjoining the capitol by Manlius,
may have excited similar feelings; and possibly he was
considered in some degree as an equivalent for Laud.</p>

<p>Extract from a History written in 1781:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“William, Thomas, and Hugh Peters were brothers,
and born at Fowey in Cornwall. Their father was a merchant
of large property, and their mother was Elizabeth
<!--078.png--><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="pageno">72</span>
Treffry, daughter of John Treffry, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of a very ancient
and opulent family in that town.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“William received his education at Leyden, Thomas at
Oxford, and Hugh at Cambridge. Between the years
1610 and 1620 Thomas and Hugh became clergymen in
London. William continued a private gentleman. About
the year 1628 Thomas and Hugh having rendered themselves
obnoxious by their popularity and puritanic preaching,
were silenced by the Bishop. They then went to Holland
and remained till 1633, when they returned to London.
The three brothers then sold their landed property, and in
the following year embarked for America. Hugh settled
at Salem, and soon became so popular as to excite the jealousy
of those who had previously swayed the fanatical
opinions of that place. Mr. Hugh Peters was in a short time
appointed a trustee of the college at New Cambridge. He
built a grand house, and purchased a large tract of land.
The yard before his house he paved with flint-stones from
England; and having dug a well he paved that also with
flint-stones, for the accommodation of every inhabitant in
want of water. It bears the name of Peter’s Spring up to
the present time.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“He here married a second time, and had one daughter
named Elizabeth. His renown as a zealot increasing, he
received an invitation to remove from Salem to Boston,
with which he complied, and there laid the foundation-stone
of the great meeting-house, of which the Reverend
Doctor Samuel Cooper, one of the most learned literati in
America, is the pastor. Those whose envy he had excited
at Salem, ill brooked being thus outrivalled by Mr. Peters.
Yet finding him an orthodox fanatic, and more powerful
than themselves, they seemingly bowed to his superiority,
at the same time that they were contriving a plan which
ended in his destruction.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“In 1641 they conspired with the civil authorities of Boston
to convert their leading priest into a politician, by appointing
him agent to Great Britain. The plot succeeded,
<!--079.png--><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><span class="pageno">73</span>
and Mr. Hugh Peters assumed his agency under colour of
petitioning for some abatement of customs and excise; but
his real commission was to foment the civil discontents,
wars, and jars then prevailing between the King and the
Parliament. He did not see into the motives of these people;
and he felt a strong inclination to chastise the Court
and the Bishop of London, who had turned him out of the
church for his fanatical conduct.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“On Mr. Peters’s arrival in London, the Parliament
took him into their service. The Earls of Warwick and
of Essex were also his patrons. In 1644 the Parliament
gave him Archbishop Laud’s library, and soon afterwards
made him head of the Archbishop’s court, and gave him
the estate and palace at Lambeth; all which he kept till
the Restoration.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The people of Boston conducted themselves with ingratitude
and neglect towards Mr. Peters; they never paid
him any part of the stipend attached to his office, although
he discharged the duties of it during twenty years, and obtained
from the Protector a charter for the Society for propagating
the Gospel in New England, which, by contributions
raised in Great Britain, has supported all the missionaries
among the Indians to the present time.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“An occurrence at the melancholy close of Mr. Peters’s
life evinces his firmness of mind and self-possession.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The sentences of our law, now barbarous in words alone,
were in those days executed with horrors so savage, as to
forbid description. The scenes of cruelty were repeated
one after the other; and in his own case Mr. Peters, either
from design or accident, remained to witness on others the
inflictions which awaited himself. At that moment an officer
whose heart must have been more obdurate than the
hardest flint, or than <a name="chg_2" id="chg_2"></a>Marperian rock, inquired of him how
he liked the proceeding, and received for answer, ‘Friend,
thou doest ill to <a name="chg_3" id="chg_3"></a>distress a dying man!’”</p>

And this barton of Penwarne hath also still extant upon it
an old unendowed free chapel and burying-place of public

<p>From Pen-gwarne alias Pen-warne, synonymous words,
was denominated an old English family of gentlemen now
in possession thereof, surnamed De-Penwarne (who by
possession of those lands is bailiff or lord of the bailiwick of
the hundred of Kerryer by inheritance), whose ancestors
have been seised and possessed thereof, beyond the records
of time, and have been possessed in former ages of divers
other lands of considerable value in those parts.</p>

<p>The manor of Trevose, that is, the town in the valley,
from its principal mansion so called, where are the ruins of
a very large house, as having been formerly a seat of the
Killigrews, and particularly in J. Norden’s time of Sir
William Killigrew, to which family, together with other
lands adjoining, I suppose it came by their marriage with
the daughter and heir of Arwinick. This property was
sold to Sir Nicholas Slanning of Marystow in Devonshire,
who I believe made this place his residence, while he was
Governor of Pendinas Castle. This was the famous Sir
<!--082.png--><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><span class="pageno">76</span>
Nicholas Slanning, so much cried up for his valour, who
had a chief command in the King’s army, and was killed
before Bristol in July 1643. He left a son of the same
name, then an infant, who was made a Baronet by King
Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> in 1662, as he had been before that one of the
Knights of the Bath at his Majesty’s Coronation; which
Sir Nicholas Slanning gave for his arms, Argent, two pales
ingrailed Gules, over all a bend Azure, charged with three
griffin’s heads erased Or.</p>

<p>This gentleman sold Trerose to Brian Rogers of Falmouth,
merchant, who left by his wife, the daughter of
John Tregeagle of Trevorden, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> one only son, Peter
Rogers, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who dying under age, the estate was sold to
pay his father’s debts, under the authority of an Act of
Parliament, to James Kempe of Penryn, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who settled it
on his second son James Kempe; but he died in his father’s
lifetime; and, therefore, on his father’s death, in 1711, it
fell to his son John Kempe, who marrying Mary the daughter
of Joshua Ratcliff of Francklyn in Devonshire, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
died in May 1714, leaving an only daughter, who died
soon afterwards. The manor ultimately devolved to Nicholas
Kempe of Rosteage, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who is the present lord
thereof. Mr. Rogers gave for his arms, as deriving himself
from the Rogerses of Cannington in Somersetshire,
Argent, a chevron between three bucks courant Sable, attired
Or.</p>

<p>The advowson of the parish was appendant to this manor,
but has been severed therefrom, and now belongs to
John Peters, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Harlyn.</p>

<p>In this parish is also Penwarne. This has been for many
generations the seat of an ancient family of the same name,
where they have flourished, being Justices of the Peace,
and Members of Parliament; they began, however, to decline
about the middle of Queen Elizabeth’s time, till Peter
Penwarne, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> parted with almost the whole of his landed
property, except the barton. The present gentleman
married Joan, the daughter of Thomas Taylder of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>

<p>The northern part of this parish consists of felspathic
hornblend rocks, belonging to the porphyritic series,
which nearly touches the granite of Constantine and Budock.
The southern part of Mawnan is situated on the
calcareous series, and some of its rocks are very interesting,
particularly those in the cliffs near the church and Rosemullion

<p>Who the supposed tutelar guardian of this church, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Maddarne, was, is past my ability of finding out, either in
<!--085.png--><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a><span class="pageno">79</span>
the legends or martyrologies, therefore refer him to the
scrutiny of the inhabitants; only by the way let it be remembered
that Galfridus Monmouthensis tells us in his
Chronicle that one Madan was a British king in these
parts before Julius Cæsar landed in Britain, and probably
that he lived or died here, in memory of whom this parish
is called Madran, now Maddarne. Here also is Maddarne
Well of water, greatly famous for its healing virtues,
of which thus writes Bishop Hall of Exeter, in his book
called the Great Mystery of Godliness, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 169, where,
speaking of what good offices angels do God’s servants.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Of which kind was that noe less then miraculous cure,
which at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Maddarn’s Well in Cornwall was wrought
upon a poore criple; wherof, besides the attestation of
many hundreds of the neighbours, I tooke a strict and impartial
examination in my last triennial Visitation there.
This man for sixteen years was forced to walke upon his
hands, by reason of the sinews of his leggs were soe contracted
that he cold not goe or walk on his feet, who upon
monition in a dreame, to wash in that well, which accordingly
he did, was suddainly restored to the use of his limbs,
and I sawe him both able to walk and gett his owne maintenance.
I found here was neither art or collusion, the
cure done, the author our invisible God, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>”</p>

<p>However, notwithstanding this instance of that Reverend
Bishop’s, I know no medicinal waters in Cornwall that are
constantly and universally sovereign for any disease, but
only to some particular persons, at times and seasons.</p>

<p>Alvorton, alias Alverton, in this parish, was the Voke
lands of a considerable manor heretofore pertaining to the
Kings and Earls of Cornwall, and under that jurisdiction
and name this district of Maddern was taxed, 20 William <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
1087, as also Paul Parish; it consisted, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>
of eighty-four Cornish acres of land. Carew’s Survey of
Cornwall, page 46, that is to say 3600 statute acres. (Page
131 of Lord Dunstanville’s Edition; the Cornish Acres 64).</p>

<p>Within the confines of this parish, or the said manor,
<!--086.png--><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><span class="pageno">80</span>
stands Mayne Screffes, that is to say, the written or inscribed
stone, being a monument set up of a rough perpendicular
stone, in memory of a famous Cornish-British
Prince or King, that probably lived and died here, and
was interred near the same, in which stone are yet extant
these British and Latin words: “RIALOBRAN CUNOWALL
FIL:” [id est, Rialobran the son of Cunowall]
which contracted Latin word fil. for filius, shows that it
was made and erected there since first the Romans came
into this land, for the Britains before had no knowledge of
the Latin tongue; which words, if not monosyllables, are
compounded either of those particles Rial-o-Bren-Cunowall
fil: Extraordinary Royal or Imperial Prince King of
Wales son; or rather it ought to be thus read, Rial-o-Bren-Cornowall
filius, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> the extraordinary Royal Prince
or King of Cornwall’s Son. For as Rial in British answers
to Regalis, Regius, Augustus, Regificus, Basilicus, in
Latin, so -o- by itself to nimius, id est, much, excessive,
overmuch; and Bren, Brene, to Princeps, a Prince, Ruler,
or Chief Governor. However, let it be remembered, in
favour of the second etymology, that one Bletius (son to
Roderick King of Wales and Cornwall, anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 700,)
was Prince of Wales and also King or Prince of Cornwall.
But this funeral monument stone must have been erected
before that time; for afterwards it became lawful to bury
dead human creatures in towns and cities, lastly in churches
and churchyards, though not before. [See Dr. Borlase’s
Antiquities, <abbr title="second">2d</abbr> <abbr title="edition">edit.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 391, and the plate in Lysons’s Cornwall,

<p>Upon the south part of this parish, at the head of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Michael’s Mount’s Bay, on a little promontory of land
shooting into the sea, is situate the market and coinage
town of Pensance, or Penzance, which stands now rated in
the Exchequer as a noun substantive, or distinct jurisdiction
from Maddarne; whereas the borough of Camelford
is taxed under Lenteglos, Mitchell under Newlan, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Enedor-Bosithney under Dundagell.</p>

<p>The old chapel, and the whole town of Penzance, the
20th July 1595, was burnt to ashes by five Spanish galleys,
that then came into <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount’s Bay for that purpose,
of which fact there is a large history to be seen in
Mr. Carew’s Survey of Cornwall, page 156, (page 381, Lord
Dunstanville’s edition); since which time the new chapel
hath been founded and beautified as it now stands, and the
old town comparatively all new built of brick and stone,
and augmented with a greater number of houses than before.</p>

<p>It was incorporated by charter from King James the
First, with the jurisdiction of a court leet, by the name
of the Mayor, Aldermen, or Magistrates, before whose
tribunal all pleas of debt and damage, within the precincts
of that borough, are judged and determined by the said
charter; it is also made the fifth town for coinage of tin, at
the usual times of the year, by the Duke of Cornwall’s
officers, as also with a weekly market on Thursdays, and
fairs yearly, on Thursday before Advent Sunday, and also
on Trinity Thursday.</p>

<p>This town of Penzance, anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 1646, in the time of
the wars between King Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> and his Parliament, for
the kindness and charity the inhabitants showed to the
Lord Goring’s and Lord Hopton’s troops of horse, driven
into those parts by Sir Thomas Fairfax, the Parliament
General, was made a prey to his soldiers or troops, who
for two days had the plunder of the town and its inhabitants’
goods, to the one’s great loss and the other’s great
<!--088.png--><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><span class="pageno">82</span>
enriching; for one of those troopers, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Edward Best, of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Wenn, had to his share five gallons of English coin,
silver and gold, and pieces of eight, as I was told by one of
his servants, that was the measurer and spectator thereof;
though long since all riotously spent, as also the shares of
his fellow-troopers Littlecot, Keen, and Lockyer of Roach.</p>

<p>In this port his Majesty and the Duke have their coinage
hall for coining tin, custom-house, collector, surveyor,
comptroller, and wayters for sea and land service. The
chief inhabitants of this town are John Carveth, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> attorney-at-law,
Mr. Gross, of the same profession, Mr. Tremenheer,
Mr. Williams, Mr. Veale, Mr. Rawlinge.</p>

<p>The arms of this town, through ignorance of the true
etymology of the name thereof, is <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John Baptist’s head
in a charger.</p>

<p>To remove an action at law depending in the leet of
Penzance to a superior court, the writ must be thus directed:

<p>On the east side of this town, on the sea shore, at the
top of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount’s Bay, stands that notable
treble intrenchment of earth, after the British manner,
built as a rampart or fortress for defence of the country
against foreign invaders, called Les-cad-dock Castle; otherwise

James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> on the 9th day of May, in the 12th year of his
Highness’s reign, by the name of Mayor, Aldermen, and
commonalty of the village of Penzance, and by that name

succession, and to be persons in the law, capable to
purchase and possess lands, to consist of a Mayor, annually
chosen, of eight other Aldermen, and twelve Assistants.</p>

<p>And at the time of the Heralds’ Visitation, the 9th day of

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The church of Maddern stands on a commanding elevation,
and retains indications of its former connexion with
the Knights Templars, who are believed to have had a
preceptory or provincial establishment at Landithy, immediately
adjoining.</p>

<p>In the church and churchyard are monuments to various
distinguished families resident within the parish: Borlase,
Nicholls, Arundell, Harris, Pearce, Jenkin, Heckens, Clies,
Pascoe, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>; and some in memory of strangers, who too
long delayed availing themselves of the mild climate and
salubrious air of the Mount’s Bay. One of the more ancient
monuments has these lines:</p>

<p>Castle Horneck is thought to be the site of a castle denominated
<!--090.png--><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><span class="pageno">84</span>
Hornec, or iron, from its supposed strength, and
built by the Tyers, who were lords of this district early in
the times of the Plantagenets.</p>

<p>This place was the residence during a long life, of the
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Walter Borlase, Doctor of Civil Law, Vice-Warden
of the Stannaries, and Vicar of Maddern for more than
fifty-five years, who died April 26, 1776, aged 81 years
and six months.</p>

<p>Doctor Borlase appears to have been universally respected,
as a man of ability and learning, and for firmness
and decision of character. He was the eldest son of Mr.
John Borlase, of Pendeen in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just, sometime Member
of Parliament for <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, and brother of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William
Borlase, also Doctor of Civil Law, and Rector of
Ludgvan, our justly celebrated historian.</p>

<p>Doctor Walter Borlase married Margaret, daughter of
the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Henry Pendarves, vicar of the adjoining parish of
Paul; and he is said in consequence of this marriage to
have quitted the law, in which profession he could scarcely
have failed of attaining some considerable distinction. They
had a very numerous family of sons and daughters; but,
none of the sons having left a son, the family estate has
passed, under an entail, to the descendants of Doctor
William Borlase, and now belongs to his great-grandson.</p>

<p>Doctor Walter Borlase built the house at Castle Horneck.
The family arms are, Ermine, on a bend Sable, two hands
issuing at the elbows from as many clouds Proper, and
rending a horseshoe Or.</p>

<p>Trereife has been long the residence of the Nicholls’s,
of whom the most distinguished person was Frank Nicholls,
M.D. Physician to King George the Second, and son-in-law
of the celebrated Dr. Mead. His life has been written
in Latin by Dr. Lawrence, sometime President of the
College of Physicians, with his portrait. It appears from
this work that Dr. Nicholls was born in 1699, that he became
a member of Exeter College, Oxford, in March 1714,
took his degree of Doctor of Medicine in 1729, and was
<!--091.png--><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><span class="pageno">85</span>
chosen a Fellow of the College of Physicians in the following
year, being previously a Fellow of the Royal Society.
Nine different communications from Doctor Nicholls are
printed in the Philosophical Transactions, and he published
a separate work: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“De Anima Medica,”</span> to which is
added a treatise, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“De Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Homine
Nato et non Nato.”</span></p>

<p>His reputation stands deservedly very high as an Anatomist.
Several dissections of the viper’s head and poisonous
fangs, engraved for Dr. Mead’s work, are believed to be
his; and to him is attributed the invention of what are
termed corroded preparations. He died in January 1778,
having completed his 79th year.</p>

<p>This gentleman’s elder brother married in London, but
finally settled at Trereife, with one son and two daughters.
The two daughters married, the eldest Mr. Love of Penzance,
the second William Harris, of Kenegie, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> but
neither left any family. The son, William Nicholls, married
Miss Ustick, of Penzance, and died leaving one son.
Mrs. Nicholls subsequently married the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Charles Valentine
Le Grice, of Bury <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Edmunds, then Lecturer of
Penzance, and bore him a son, who, together with Mr. Le
Grice, now hold the estate as tenants in remainder, and by
the courtesy, under the will of Mr. Nicholls, Jun. who lived
to the age of twenty-three or twenty-four years.</p>

<p>Trengwainton appears to have been inhabited by branches
of the Arundell family, for a long series of years, and finally
the last Mr. Arundell, of Menadarva, removed there, having
in a great measure rebuilt the house. Soon after his
decease it was sold, and Mr. Praed, of Trevethow, became
the purchaser. Trengwainton was <a name="err_3" id="err_3"></a>thus chiefly used as a
farm-house till the late Sir Rose Price, wishing to form a
seat in that neighbourhood, obtained it as an accommodation
from the late Mr. Praed, and under his hands it has
become a splendid residence.</p>

<p>It appears that a gentleman of the name of Price accompanied
Venables and Penn in their successful expedition
<!--092.png--><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><span class="pageno">86</span>
against Jamaica, during the Protectorate, and obtained an
extensive grant of land, which his descendants lived on and
improved, till early in the last century one of the sons was
sent to England for education and health. It is understood
that Doctor Nicholls was consulted as a physician,
and that he recommended the climate of Penzance; perhaps
Mr. John Price may have been the first invalid ever
sent from a distance to breathe the soft air of this all but
island in the Atlantic. At that time Mr. Henry Badcock,
from the parish of <a name="err_4" id="err_4"></a>Whilstone, in the north-eastern extremity
of Cornwall, held the office of Collector at Penzance,
where he had married Parthenia Keigwin, daughter of Mr.
John Keigwin, of Mousehole. The young patient was received
into their house by Mr. and Mrs. Badcock, who
had several daughters. Mr. Price married in the year 1736
Margery, one of their daughters; but having gone back to
Jamaica he died there three years afterwards, leaving her
with an only son, also John Price.</p>

<p>This gentleman, having gone through the usual stages of
education, ending with Trinity College, Oxford, went also
to Jamaica, and there married Elizabeth Williams Bramer,
daughter of John Bramer, a physician. They had only
one son, who lived to a mature age, and succeeded his
father in January 1797.</p>

<p>Mr. Rose Price, in the subsequent year, married Miss
Elizabeth Lambert, a young lady from the county of
Meath, born on the 12th of April 1782, by a singular coincidence
on the very day that Admiral Rodney’s victory
saved Jamaica from being captured by the French, and
therefore about sixteen at the time of her marriage. Mr.
Price served the office of Sheriff for Cornwall in the year
1814, as his father had done forty years before, in the year
1774. In this year also he was made a Baronet, in consequence
of a promise from King George the Fourth, then
Regent.</p>

<p>Lady Price died early in life, leaving a large family; and
<!--093.png--><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a><span class="pageno">87</span>
Sir Rose Price died on the 29th September 1834, having
nearly completed his 65th year.</p>

<p>And here I would add a few lines to commemorate a
gentleman whose progress through life was mainly guided
by his connexion with this family, and whose conduct reflects
credit on them for their choice.</p>

<p>In compliance with a custom evidently derived from the
Catholic times of our forefathers, when every thing relating
to the church was transacted in the language of ancient
Rome, all boys whose parents were raised above the lowest
state in society, went for six or twelve months to a Latin
school. Mr. John Vinicombe was among the number, but
his progress exhibited so great a superiority above other
scholars of his age, that Mr. <a name="err_5" id="err_5"></a>Perkin, the Lecturer and
schoolmaster, prevailed on his father to allow of his staying
an additional year. Just at that moment Mr. John Price
placed his son at the same school; and, at the suggestion
probably of Mr. Perkin, Mr. Price was induced to purchase
at some small premium a further continuance of Mr.
Vinicombe at the school, that he might assist, instruct, and
be in some degree the companion of Mr. Rose Price.</p>

<p>A connexion thus formed naturally went on; Mr. Vinicombe
became a member of Pembroke College, Oxford,
where he obtained a Fellowship; attended Mr. Rose Price
to the school at Harrow, and acted as his private tutor
when he became a gentleman commoner of Magdalen;
made with him the tour of Europe; and finally, attended
his friend and former pupil to Jamaica, where, by a residence
of about two years, they nearly doubled the value of
the estate. Soon after their return to England Mr. Vinicombe
went to his Fellowship, and became not only a
college tutor but one of the Public Examiners, under the
then recent statute, and he had confident expectations of
preferment in the church; but a premature death terminated
his useful and honourable career, occasioned (or
hastened at least) by a fall from his horse. An excellent
<!--094.png--><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><span class="pageno">88</span>
picture of Mr. Vinicombe, by Mr. Opie, has gone to Pembroke
College, under the will of Sir Rose Price.</p>

<p>Rosecadgwell has been for a considerable time in the
family of Borlase. Mr. John Borlase, father of the two
Doctor Borlases, removed there from Pendeen in the latter
portion of his life; and Samuel Borlase, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> representative
of this ancient and respectable family, resides there at
present.</p>

<p>Nanceolvern almost adjoins Rosecadgwell. This was
the residence of Mr. Carverth. After building there an
excellent house, Mr. Carverth died in very embarrassed
circumstances, which gave rise to an unusual extent of
litigation. This place, however, was purchased by one of
the Mr. Urlicks, and it now belongs to Mr. Scobell, who
married the heiress of that branch of the family.</p>

<p>Poltare has a large and decorated house, built by the
late Mr. Richard <a name="err_6" id="err_6"></a>Heckens, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, who married one of
the daughters and coheiresses of Mr. George Veale. That
place has passed by purchase also to the Scobell family.</p>

<p>Trenear was formerly a seat of the Olivers. The last of
this family, Doctor William Oliver, a physician, died at
Bath in 1764; and another William Oliver, M.D. had the
honour of accompanying King William in the expedition
which placed him on the throne, to preserve the civil and
religious liberties of England. Trenear was sold soon
after the younger Dr. Oliver’s decease, and purchased by
Mr. Robyns, who built there a good house, and made it a
gentleman’s seat. It afterwards became the property and
residence of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Anthony Williams, sometime Vicar
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kevern, and it has passed with one of his daughters
and coheiresses to Henry Pendarves Tremenheere, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
late Captain of one among the first-rate ships in the East
India Company’s Service, where he merited and obtained
the approbation, esteem, and respect of every individual
with whom he had the slightest connexion, and the same
effects of honour, ability, and kindness of heart, have followed
him into retirement.</p>

<p><!--095.png--><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><span class="pageno">89</span>
Rose Hill has a good house, built about the commencement
of this century by Richard Oxnam, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who served
the office of Sheriff in the year 1810. It has since become
the property and residence of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Uriah Tonkin, recently
appointed Vicar of Lelant.</p>

<p>Lariggan is remarkable for the beauty of its situation;
having been selected, and a neat house built there, by
Mr. Thomas Pascoe, a worthy and respectable magistrate.
And just above the town of Penzance stands a house having
almost the appearance of a palace, built some years since
by an individual of the name of Pope.</p>

<p>Mr. Pope was originally from Camelford; he conducted
business for some time at Bristol, and then emigrated to
the United States, where he accumulated a large fortune,
unknown and forgotten by his family; till on a sudden he
appeared at Penzance, recognised some relations, and,
having purchased a few acres of ground, he built this magnificent
house, which instantly became known by general
acclamation as the Vatican, a name suited at once to its
splendour, to its elevated situation, and to its founder’s
name. Mr. Pope scarcely lived to inhabit this mansion; but
left it to his nephew Mr. Vibert, to whose patriotism, skill,
and perseverance, as a member of the corporation, Penzance
is mainly indebted for several of its improvements, and
especially for its new church. The house is now inhabited
by Mrs. Rogers, widow of the late Mr. John Rogers, of
Penrose, near Helston, and her daughters.</p>

<p>Lanyon was in former times the residence of one branch
of the ancient and respectable family bearing that name.
It now belongs to Mr. Rashleigh, of Menabelly; the farm,
however, possesses one of those monuments in comparison
with which all family records are modern.</p>

<p>In a croft near the side of the road leading from Penzance
towards Morva, stands the Cromleigh or Coit described
by Doctor Borlase, in p<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 230, 231, of his Antiquities,
<abbr title="second">2d</abbr> edition. It fell down and has been replaced, (see
the Logging Rock under <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Levan). Dr. Borlase mentions
<!--096.png--><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><span class="pageno">90</span>
another Cromleigh at Malfra, in this parish, and two
others in the adjoining parishes of Morva and Zennor, all
within a few miles of each other. These monuments, scattered
over a large portion of Europe, bear all the marks of
great antiquity. Their construction is rude as well as
simple, a flat but unhewn stone, laid on three columnar
stones, also in their natural slate, and all of Cyclopean dimensions.
The flat stone at Lanyon has been estimated at
twenty ton.</p>

<p>Their use is much less certain. They are generally supposed
to be sepulchral monuments; but the flat surface of
the upper stone always inclined at a small angle from the
horizon, would seem to countenance the opinion of their
being meant for religious observances, probably for sacrifices,
which is further countenanced by the etymology of
the name, if it means in Celtic the Holy Hearth.</p>

<p>Landithy, the college or preceptory of the Knights Templars,
belonged for several generations to the Flemings, a
family now quite extinct, and their property alienated.</p>

<p>The great tithes of this parish belonged to the Knights
Templars, under a gift from Henry de Pomeroy, one of
the great family of the Pomeroys, Lords of Bury Pomeroy
Castle. They were given by Henry the Eighth to some
private person, and have belonged for a considerable time
to the family of Nicholls, now Le Grice.</p>

<p>The Vicarage has passed through other hands. It is
related by Hals and Tonkin to have belonged to Fleming
and to Harris, and then by purchase to the corporation of
Penzance, from which body it passed by sale to the family
of Borlase, and is now vested in the heir-at-law, or in
the devisee of the late Samuel Borlase, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr></p>

<p>But at a remote period the baronial residence of an extensive
lordship was at Alverton, held by the Pomeroys;
and Mr. Lysons says that it passed successively through
the Tyes, Lisles, and Berkeleys, till reverting to the Crown
it was granted to Whitmore and others, and has been divided
and subdivided. Scarcely a trace can be seen at Alverton
<!--097.png--><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a><span class="pageno">91</span>
of its former magnificence. The portion still claiming
the nominal distinction of Manor of Alverton, Penzance,
and Mousehole, was bought of the Keigwins by the
late Mr. George Veale, second son of Mr. Veale, of Trevaila,
who acquired a considerable fortune at Penzance by
the practice of the law; afterwards divided between his
three daughters,&mdash;one married to Mr. <a name="err_7" id="err_7"></a>Hickens, of Poltair;
another to Mr. Baines, a Captain in the Navy; and
the third to Mr. Jenkin, an officer in the army. These
ladies, or their families, have since disposed of Alverton,
and the whole is now vested in James Halse, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> M. P.
for <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives.</p>

<p>Maddern Well is one of the numerous springs of water
almost revered in former times on account of imputed supernatural
virtues; and it has in reality, from time out of
mind, diffused health and comfort over the thousands of
persons inhabiting Penzance, the stream having been conducted
there by a winding channel of some miles in extent,
and arriving at the highest part of the town, it is enabled
to flow down to the sea through every street.</p>

<p>Penzance, the most western market town in Cornwall,
is one of the most flourishing. It appears to have
been in former times no more than a small village, occupying
the promontory now distinguished as the Quay,
where stood a chapel, dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony, the Patron
of fishermen, which in all probability gave it the name of
Pen-sance, or the holy head (land), and it seems further
probable that the new church or chapel yard may have
been an ancient fortress for the protection of the place.
Houses however gradually extended beyond this narrow
limit; and the place had acquired some magnitude, when,
in the year 1595, on the <abbr title="twenty-third">23d</abbr> of July, a predatory squadron
of ships from Spain, stood into the bay, and landing about
two hundred men, destroyed Mousehole, burnt Paul Church,
and did much injury to Penzance; see Carew, Lord Dunstanville’s
edition, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 381. But, as appears from history to
be very usual in such cases, the town arose with increased
<!--098.png--><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a><span class="pageno">92</span>
splendour from its ashes, and a charter of incorporation
having been soon after, in 1614, granted by King James
the First, measures were taken by this new body of trustees
for insuring the increase and prosperity of the district committed
to their charge. The most material of these were
purchasing the seignorage of the harbour, and of the
market, and of fairs, which according to the rude policy of
former times had been vested in private persons, for individual
benefit; the first of whom was Alice de Lisle, lady of
the manor of Alverton, about the year 1332.</p>

<p>The Corporation also acquired a piece of ground called
the three-cornered spot, on which a spacious market house
was constructed, and buildings proper for shops and for
merchandize, were raised on the three faces of the triangle.
Penzance acquired also the privilege of being a coinage
town. From this period it continued gradually to increase
in size, in wealth, and in consideration, notwithstanding
some adverse events in the Civil War, till the progress received
an almost unlooked-for acceleration by another
effort of the faithful trustees for the place, the body corporate.
They, by a series of judicious efforts, continued for
many years, at last completed a Pier, so extensive and well
placed as to afford shelter for perhaps a hundred vessels,
to admit several of the largest size used for traders, and to
afford every accommodation and facility for the shipping or
unshipping of merchandize. From the completion of this
great work in 1813, up to the present period, Penzance has
flourished beyond example; and though much may be imputed
to the general prosperity of the times, and to the
diffusion of knowledge, yet by far the greater part must be
ascribed to the management of an unappropriated fund, by
a body of honest and disinterested trustees, for the public
benefit; and the Editor is especially disposed to bear this
testimony to one Corporation, at a period (1835) when all
municipal bodies are about to be remodelled, on the alleged
ground of their insufficiency for useful purposes.</p>

<p>Penzance, for all ecclesiastical matters forming a part of
<!--099.png--><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a><span class="pageno">93</span>
the parish of Maddern, has long had a chapel of ease,
with a lecturer appointed for life by the corporation, on an
endowment made in 1680 by Mr. John Tremenheere, at
that time a merchant residing in the town, and either the
direct or collateral ancestor of the very respectable family
of that name still remaining in the town and neighbourhood.</p>

<p>It has since been augmented by Queen Anne’s Bounty;
but, the chapel having become wholly inadequate to the
population, a church has been built in its place, accompanied
by a lofty tower, and all constructed of granite, so
as to add, in a most extraordinary degree, to the beauty of
the town, and at the same time to afford every convenience
that the space could possibly admit; and it is pleasing to
add, that the work has been conducted and executed by all
the parties concerned, in a manner highly creditable to their
taste, to their judgment, and to their care in the expenditure
of public money. But among the gentlemen who
have exerted themselves in different ways, it would be unfair
not particularly to mention Mr. Vibert, whose general
skill, ability, and accurate knowledge of details have been
most conspicuous throughout the whole undertaking; and
the Editor hopes that the ties of consanguinity will not be
thought of a nature to preclude him from referring here to
the late Mr. Edward Giddy, who, in the situation of chief
magistrate, conferred on him, over and over again, in every
other situation, on all occasions, and especially in regard to
this splendid and useful building, proved himself the active,
zealous, and intelligent friend of the town and of all its
inhabitants; and it is further gratifying to state, that the
existing members of the family of Tremenheere, in emulation
of their ancestor, to whom the chapel is indebted
for its original endowment, have added the splendid decoration
of painted glass over the whole east window of the
chancel. The new church will be opened for divine service
in the present year; and in this year also, as perhaps
the last act of a select corporate body, which, in the
<!--100.png--><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a><span class="pageno">94</span>
administration of an income little short in its gross amount
of two thousand pounds a year, may challenge the most
minute investigation, the town and neighbourhood will
receive the benefit of a new, commodious, and extended
market-house, with the usual appendages, fully adequate
to the still increasing opulence and commerce of the
place.</p>

<p>Penzance may justly be proud of the many distinguished
families and individuals connected with it: Clive, Fleming,
Borlase, Tremenheere, Tonkin, Veale, John, Pellew, Batten,
Carne, Davy, Boase, Colston, Giddy. It would require
a volume to give even a slight history of each family,
and of its individual members.</p>

<p>The Tonkins were long represented by Mr. Uriah Tonkin,
who, through a life extended far beyond the period
usually assigned to human nature, obtained universal regard
and esteem. This gentleman had several sons; from
one of whom is descended the Reverend Uriah Tonkin, now
Vicar of Lelant. Another son, Mr. John Tonkin, pursued
the practice of medicine till he succeeded to the family estate.
He was distinguished for ability, good nature, and for quaintness
of expressions in the form of apophthegms; but the
most remarkable incident in Mr. John Tonkin’s life was his
adoption of Humphry Davy, with the intention of educating
him to the medical profession, and making him his
successor. Davy, having succeeded to a small fortune
on the decease of his father, soared above the narrow
limits of a country practitioner, and was preparing himself
for Edinburgh, when the Editor most fortunately
directed his course to Clifton, where Dr. Beddoes was
then engaged in applying pneumatic chemistry in aid of
the Bristol waters for the cure or alleviation of incipient
consumption; from thence he fought his way to the pinnacle
of honour attached to experimental science.</p>

<p>Everything of importance in the life of this extraordinary
man has been given with accuracy and ability by Doctor
<!--101.png--><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a><span class="pageno">95</span>
Paris, in a Life of Davy, 1 <abbr title="volume quarto">vol 4to</abbr>. or 2 <abbr title="volumes octavo">vols. 8vo.</abbr>
Colburn and Bentley. 1831.</p>

<p>The family of Batten have been for some time the leading
merchants of Penzance. They have recently lost Mr.
John Batten, distinguished by the intelligence and liberality
incident to gentlemen in that profession; but he has
left a family more than promising to support his reputation
and the credit of his ample fortune; and this family
has the honour of possessing the Reverend Joseph Hallett
Batten, <abbr title="Doctor of Divinity">D.D.</abbr> Principal of the East India College.</p>

<p>This gentleman having been placed at Trinity College,
Cambridge, by the Editor’s recommendation, immediately
distinguished himself in the public examinations and by
obtaining college prizes; and on taking his degree Mr.
Batten became Third Wrangler. These honours led at
once to a Fellowship, and to the most desirable private
tuitions; and, having married, he was placed at the head
of an institution destined to prepare the minds and the
habits of young men for the government of a vast empire.</p>

<p>Mr. William Carne came to Penzance about sixty years
ago, where, by active and intelligent industry, he has acquired
an ample fortune. Of his son, Mr. Joseph Carne,
it would not be an easy task to speak in terms sufficiently
laudatory: I therefore refer to his communications in the
Transactions of the Geological Society of Cornwall, to
his most ample and valuable collection of natural history,
and to his patronage of every institution established for
the diffusion of knowledge.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Boase left Cornwall at an early age, and
became the active partner in a London bank, from whence
he returned to Penzance, and conferred important benefits
on the town as a magistrate and member of the corporation,
and by the judicious employment of his capital.
His eldest son Dr. Henry S. Boase supports, as Secretary,
the Geological Society, instituted by Doctor Paris
in the year 1814. Besides papers in these Transactions,
Dr. Boase has published, “Primary Geology,” a
<!--102.png--><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a><span class="pageno">96</span>
separate work, in 1 <abbr title="volume octavo">vol. 8vo.</abbr> Longman and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr> 1834,
which has attracted the attention of natural philosophers
throughout Europe; and although this is not the place to
express my individual gratitude, yet I may say, that the
most valuable additions to Mr. Hals’s and Mr. Tonkin’s
parochial histories will be found in Doctor Boase’s geological
description of each separate parish.</p>

<p>I cannot omit here to notice, among the inhabitants who
have done credit to Penzance, my late respected relation
Mr. Thomas Giddy, as a gentleman, a scholar, and a man
of unblemished reputation. He came to Penzance in the
year 1774, was chosen Mayor ten different times, and in his
last mayoralty mainly assisted in carrying into execution
a great improvement of the town, by removing the Coinage
Hall from a place adjoining the Market House, to a proper
situation near the quay, permission for which the Editor
had the good fortune to obtain from the Lord Warden and
the Duchy Officers. Mr. Giddy died July the 26th, 1825,
having nearly completed his eighty-fourth year, and having
somewhat more than completed the sixtieth year of his
marriage. His widow survived him about five years.</p>

<p>Dr. Stephen Luke was also from Penzance. He practised
with much success and reputation at Falmouth, Exeter,
and London, where he died on the 30th of March
1829.</p>

<p>Finally, I may state that the intrepid and successful
Admiral Pellew, although not a native of Penzance, received
his nautical education in this town.</p>

<p>A grammar school has long been endowed by the Corporation;
and the master used formerly to hold in addition
the lecturership of the chapel.</p>

<p>The Reverend James Parkin, afterwards Rector of Okeford
in Devonshire, held both offices for a considerable
time; and under his care, for about eighteen months, the
Editor received the only instruction for which he is indebted
to a stranger.</p>

<p><!--103.png--><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a><span class="pageno">97</span>
The school is now presided over by the Reverend Mr.
Morris, M.A. from Balliol College, Oxford; and Mr. Le-Grice
having resigned the lecturership, after holding it above
twenty years, has been succeeded by the Reverend Mr.
Vyvyan, of Trelowarren.</p>

<p>Penzance has become, in the last half century, a considerable
resort of invalids; and much benefit has been received
in pulmonary cases from the mildness and comparatively
even temperature of the climate, which has been most
satisfactorily established by the observations of Mr. Edward
Giddy, printed in the Journal of Philosophy. For a
detailed account of Penzance and of the Mount’s Bay, in a
medical point of view, the reader is referred to the works
of Dr. Paris, who resided some years in the town, till he
left it to acquire one of the most extensive fields of practice
in London.</p>

<p>An event occurred at Penzance in the year 1760, of a
nature so curious as to be well worthy of remembrance.
This country was then deeply engaged in what has since
been termed the seven years’ war; and, notwithstanding the
splendid successes of 1759, the nation still felt alarm
from the always threatened invasion by France, and from
the fear of predatory excursions, when in the night following
the 29th of September the town was roused by the
firing of guns, and soon after by the intelligence of a
large ship of a strange appearance having run on shore on
the beach towards Newlyn. Great numbers of persons
crowded to the spot, where they were still more astonished
and shocked by the sight of men still stranger than their
vessel, each armed with a scymetar and with pistols. It
was now obvious that they were Moslems; and a vague
fear of Turkish ferocity, of massacre and plunder, seised
the unarmed inhabitants, just awakened from their sleep in
the middle of the night. A volunteer company obeyed,
however, with alacrity the beat to arms, and 172 men were
conducted or driven into a spacious building which then
stood on the Western Green, and for some reason or other
<!--104.png--><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a><span class="pageno">98</span>
was called the Folly. Eight men were found to be
drowned. Before morning it was ascertained from themselves,
by some who understood the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lingua Franca</i>, that the
ship was an Algerine corsair, carrying 24 guns, from nine
to six pounders, and that the Captain had steered his vessel
into the Mount’s Bay, and run it against the shore
under a full conviction that he was safe in the Atlantic
Ocean, at about the latitude of Cadiz, thus committing an
error of thirteen degrees in latitude. The instant it was
known that the sailors were Algerines, a fear seized the
town and neighbourhood scarcely less formidable than the
other of massacre and plunder&mdash;namely, of the plague.
The volunteers, however, kept watch and ward to prevent
all intercourse. Intelligence was conveyed to the government,
and orders are said to have been issued for troops to
march from Plymouth for surrounding the whole district;
but most fortunately the local authorities ascertained that
no cause whatever existed for such a precaution, and the
orders were countermanded.</p>

<p>When it was found safe to visit the strangers, curiosity
attracted the whole neighbourhood. Their Asiatic dress,
long beards and mustachios, with turbans, the absence of
all covering from their feet and legs, the dark complexion
and harsh features of a piratical band, made them objects
of terror and of surprise.</p>

<p>They were on the whole treated kindly; their vessel had
totally disappeared, and consequently after some delay a
ship of war took all the men on board, and conveyed them
to Algiers.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>A large portion of this parish is situated on granite, the
boundary line of which extends from near the church, in
a semicircular form, to Buryas Bridge. South of this line
the parish consists of felspar, hornblend, and actynolite
rocks, all of which occur both in massive and in schistose
forms. A fine instance of the latter may be seen at the
back of the quay at Penzance, and may be traced for some
distance in a westerly direction on the sea shore below
high-water mark. About half way to Newlyn another bed of
porphyry, or an irregular continuation of the former, was
a few years since explored for tin, and became the celebrated
Wherry Mine, yielding not only a large quantity
of tin, so as to afford profit after paying the expenses of a
<!--106.png--><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a><span class="pageno">100</span>
steam-engine, but also beautiful specimens of rare metallic
minerals. For an account of this curious submarine mine,
Mr. Hawkins’ Paper in the Transactions of the Cornwall
Geological Society, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> 1, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 127, may be consulted; and
in the third volume of the same work, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 166, will be
found an account of the sand bank and submarine forest
existing near the same spot (by Dr. Boase. <abbr title="Editor"><span class="sc">Ed.</span></abbr>). Every
part of this parish appears to be intersected with metalliferous
veins; some copper and small quantities of lead
have been raised, but tin is the only metal that has yet
proved of importance.</p>

<p>To the above the Editor must add, that Penzance has
the good fortune to possess a geological and mineralogical
treasure peculiarly its own.</p>

<p>In the year 1814 Doctor Paris and Mr. Ashurst Majendie
began to institute the Geological Society, and to
form a museum. The Society has flourished far beyond
any expectation that could have been originally formed;
and the collection has been enriched by the liberality of
Mr. Carne, Dr. Barham, Mr. Henwood, and others; but,
above all, by Doctor Boase, who has deposited specimens
from all parts of Cornwall, collected on an actual survey
extended to each individual parish. All these specimens
are arranged, labelled, and numbered, with reference to
their localities and to his admirable work.</p>

<p>For the general arrangement of the cabinet, with indexes,
<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> the Society and the public are indebted to the
ingenuity and industry of the late Mr. Edward Giddy;
and the room of the Cornwall Geological Society at Penzance
may justly be pointed out to scientific strangers as
the object most worthy of their attention throughout the
whole extent of the country.</p>

<p>Part of Maker, and those lands called Mount Edgcumbe,
were formerly the lands of Durneford of Devon, of which
family, Stephen Durneford was Sheriff of Devon 6 Henry <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr>
1413, and of Cornwall 7 Henry <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> 1419, whose great
granddaughter, (the issue male failing) the sole heir of the
family, was married to Sir Piers Edgcumbe, Knight, Lord
of Cotehele in Cornwall by long inheritance, and of East
Stonehouse in Devon, whose ancestor Peter Edgcumbe,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> 12 Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> 1443, was certified by the Commissioners
to be one of the gentry of the county of Devon.
He was the father of Richard Edgcumbe, afterwards
knighted, Sheriff of Devon <abbr title="second">2d</abbr> Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> 1487, when
John Tremayne was Sheriff of Cornwall; the which Mr.
Edgcumbe was a gentleman that hazarded his life and fortune
in espousing the Earl of Richmond’s case and title to
the Crown in opposition to King Richard <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> He then
lived at Cotehele aforesaid in Calstock parish; and being
<!--108.png--><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><span class="pageno">102</span>
discovered to be one of that faction or party, he was forced
to abscond and retire into the thick woods that then were
and still are about Cotehele; nevertheless, King Richard,
having notice of his absconding, ordered his officers to
make diligent search for him, and in all probability had
taken him, had he not rescued himself from their pursuit
by an unparalleled accident, as Mr. Carew in his Survey of
Cornwall, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 114, (page 270, Lord Dunstanville’s edition),
informs us, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> “at such tymes as those searchers were in
his woods, and himself hid in a secret hole of the sea cliffe,
the tide being full up, he put a small stone into his wearinge
cap and threw it into the sea, which swimming in the
water the winds and waves tossed it to and fro that it soone
came to those seekers’ sight and observation.”</p>

<p>Whereupon they concluded he had leapt into the sea
and drowned himself for fear of their discovery and being
taken by them, and so left over further quest after him,
which gave him opportunity soon after in a small ship to
waft over the British Channel to Britany to the Earl of
Richmond, with whom afterwards he returned again into
England, and was engaged with him in the battle of Bosworth
Field in Leicestershire, where King Richard’s army
was overthrown and himself slain upon the spot. When
soon after the said Mr. Edgcumbe was by King Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>
knighted and made one of his Privy Council; and as a
further reward of his good services, rewarded with the
whole estate and lands of inheritance of Sir Henry Trenoweth,
of Bodrigan, Knight, of a very great value, then
forfeited by attainder of treason on the part of King
Richard <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> against King Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>; as also with the
Castle and Lordship of Totnes in Devon, with much other
lands of John Lord Zouch, then also for the same fact forfeited
by attainder of treason against King Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr></p>

<p>This Sir Richard Edgcumbe, Knight, married Tremayne,
and had issue Peers, afterwards knighted, that married
Durneford’s heir aforesaid, and had issue Richard,
afterwards knighted, that married Tregian, of Walveden,
<!--109.png--><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="pageno">103</span>
who had issue Peter, that married Margaret, daughter of
Sir Andrew Luttrell, Knight, in the latter end of Queen
Elizabeth’s reign, who gave for his arms, Gules, on a bend
Ermine between two cottices Or, three boar’s heads
couped. Sir Richard Edgcumbe, Knight, Privy Councillor
to King Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> as Mr. Carew saith, in the place
where he hid himself in Cotehele woods aforesaid, built a
chapel to the honour of Almighty God, in testimony of
his thankful remembrance of God’s preserving him from
the hands of his enemies then at his heels.</p>

<p>Him or his father I take also to be that Edgecumbe
which founded at West Conworthy, on the west side of the
river Dart, between the towns of Totnes and Dartmouth
in Devon, a priory of Benedictine monks, whose revenues
out of Zouch’s lands was valued 26 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> when dissolved,
63<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> 2<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 10<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> as the Monasticon Anglicanum informs
us.</p>

<p>At which time it was purchased of the Crown by William
Harris, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> father of Sir Thomas Harris, of Hayne,
Knight and Sergeant-at-law, tempore Elizabeth, who made
it the place of his residence; but in the third descent it
came to be divided between the daughters and heirs of Sir
Edward Harris, Knight, the house being now comparatively
demolished. Now as from the premises it appears those
gentlemen’s estates were greatly augmented by the bounty
of King Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> so after a grateful manner they have
converted great sums of money towards the service of their
prince and country; and to this purpose I find it recorded,
that as</p>

<p>Sir Richard Edgcumbe the first was Sheriff of Devon
<abbr title="second">2d</abbr> Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> so his son Sir Peers or Peter Edgcumbe
aforesaid, was Sheriff of Devon 10th Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> also the
13th; also the 9th of Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> also the 20th; also Sir
Richard Edgcumbe that married Tregian, and built the present
house here called Mount Edgcumbe, 36th Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>
also the 1st of Queen Mary; also Peter Edgcumbe his son
9th Elizabeth.</p>

<p><!--110.png--><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><span class="pageno">104</span>
And of Cornwall Sir Peter Edgcumbe 14th and 15th
of Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> also 21st; also 8th of Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> also
26th. Sir Richard Edgcumbe <abbr title="second">2d</abbr> and <abbr title="third">3d</abbr> of Queen Mary,
also Peter Edgcumbe 11th of Elizabeth, Richard Edgcumbe
8th James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> in all or total sixteen times Sheriff of
Cornwall and Devon, from the year 1487 to the year 1640,
which is but 150 years; the like instance of Sheriffs not to
be given of any other family in England except the Arundels,
of Lanhearne, Trerice, and Tolverne, who have been
twenty times.</p>

<p>Richard Edgcumbe, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Sheriff of Cornwall 8th of
King James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> had issue Richard Edgcumbe, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> created
one of the Knights of the Bath, at the Coronation of King
Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> He married the Lady Anne Montagu, daughter
of the Right Honourable Edward Earl of Sandwich,
and had issue Richard Edgcumbe, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr></p>

<p>Finally, Mr. Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall, hath
written so large a history of this family, the magnificence of
the house, and sweetness of the dwelling, that I refer the
reader thereto as not being able to make further addition.</p>

<p>Half of Millbrook in this parish and of Mount Edgcumbe
lands, are part of the county of Devon, though
severed from it by the Tamerworth sea or harbour ever
since King Athelstan, anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 930, separated Devon
from Cornwall, and made them several jurisdictions, which
before were but one county or regniculum; and the reason
in all probability why several parcels of land, not only here
in this place, but in divers others on the east and west side
of the Tamer river, the Devonshire side lands are annexed
to Cornwall, and the Cornwall side lands to Devon,
was in all probability by reason the owners of those lands
were possessed of lands both in Devonshire and Cornwall;
and it could not in any sense consist with justice that the
Cornish men should lose their lands in Devon, or the Devonshire
men lose their lands in Cornwall, because those
counties were divided by the river Tamar, and both people
under the dominion of one king.</p>

<p><!--111.png--><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a><span class="pageno">105</span>
This town of Milbrook, as I am informed, amongst
others was once privileged with the jurisdiction of sending
of two Members to sit in the Lower House of Parliament,
but was divested of that privilege <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">propter paupertatem,
tempore</i> Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> for that the town was
not able to pay their Burgesses’ salary of 4<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> per diem
whilst they sat in Parliament; however, Mr. Carew in
his Survey of Cornwall, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 101, tells us, that within his
memory this town had near forty ships and barks at one
time pertaining to the inhabitants thereof, that followed
trade, merchandize, and fishing; but upon the breaking
out of Queen Elizabeth’s wars with Spain, the townsmen
neglected their usual honest employments and took up a
more compendious though not so honest way of gaining,
and began by little and little to reduce those plain dealers
to their former undeserved plight, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">id est</i>, by piracy and
privateering at sea.</p>

<p>In this parish standeth Cremble Passage, the common
place of transferring passengers by boat or barge over the
rapid and dangerous waves of the Tamerworth Harbour or
Sea Haven from the Cornish shore to the Plymouth or
Devonshire side or lands, wherein many persons heretofore
by the violence of the seas and wind in their passage have
lost their lives.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>Mr. Tonkin has not noticed this parish.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>This parish, forming the western boundary of Plymouth
harbour, and extending between Hamoaze and the sea,
occupies a situation more beautiful than any other on the
whole coast.</p>

<p>The church stands on the summit of the ridge, and its
lofty tower was long an object of curiosity on account of
<!--112.png--><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a><span class="pageno">106</span>
the signals displayed on it to indicate the arrival of ships
or fleets. From ten to twenty arbitrary signals were made,
by means of differently shaped and coloured flags, displayed
from a perpendicular staff, and by balls suspended on two
others, rising at an inclined angle from the opposite parapets.</p>

<p>The tardy adoption of a method, so simple and universal
as that of conveying intelligence through the combination
of signals, and of alphabetic writing, may be reckoned
among the most curious anomalies of the human mind;
when the common mode of what is called talking with the
fingers actually does the thing itself, and Polybius, the
friend of P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus, and his companion,
at the destruction of Carthage, 145 years before our æra,
gives a detailed description of a method by which this object
may be attained, and dwells on its immense advantages.
He admits indeed that difficulties must be expected in the
execution; but adds, “In the present age the sciences are
advanced to so great a perfection that almost every thing
is capable of being taught by method.” See the General History
of Polybius, book 10, extract 7, chapter 2. It was, however,
reserved for the French, in their Revolutionary War,
to practise this art, and for the first time in the spring of
1794, more than nineteen hundred years after the suggestion
by Polybius, and notwithstanding repeated recurrences
to nearly the same effect by various writers in
modern times.</p>

The bracket may perhaps be wrongly placed, and Maker
may be a corruption of the name here used.</p>

<p>Inceworth appears to have been the principal manor in
this parish, and belongs to the family of Trefusis; it includes
Milbrook, formerly a town of some consequence.
Here were till very lately the brewhouses attached to the
great naval establishment of this port; they are now removed
to The Point on the Devonshire side, where one of
the most extensive and most useful works ever constructed
for such purposes has been recently completed. Walls
have been laid in deep water, by the use of diving bells, so
as to allow of the largest ships coming quite in contact with
the wharfs, and there receiving, in the course of a few
hours, all the supplies of meat, bread, beer, water, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> that
are requisite for their going to sea.</p>

<p>The object however which attracts the attention of
strangers from all others in this parish, is the place formerly
called Vaultershome, and afterwards West Stonehouse,
but which Mr. Edgcumbe, who acquired it by a marriage
with the heiress of the family of Durneford, its former
possessors, chose to name Mount Edgcumbe, a proceeding
now sanctioned by time, as are those of the change from
Port Prior to Port Eliot, and some others. It would be
useless to describe this most beautiful and superb place,
considered by many as altogether the finest gentleman’s seat in
the West of England. Nor can it be the least necessary to
say any thing here of the distinguished family after whom
it is called; who have possessed an hereditary seat in Parliament
since the year 1741, and for two descents have
been Lord Lieutenants of Cornwall.</p>

<p>By a strange absurdity this south-eastern extremity has
been, notwithstanding that the whole river is attached to
Cornwall, artificially considered as a part of Devonshire;
but this and other similar anomalies are in some degree
corrected by modern acts of the legislature, the authority
of magistrates for any county having been extended over
these insulated portions of another, and the right of voting
<!--114.png--><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a><span class="pageno">108</span>
for Members of Parliament is brought back to its natural
state by the enactments of 1832.</p>

<p>A small town or village, partly in Maker, but extending
into Rame, is distinguished by the double appellation of
Kingston and Cawsand; the latter name is applied to the
bay formed by a recess of the land at this place, a bay capable
of containing the largest ships, and esteemed the
least dangerous part of Plymouth Sound.</p>

<p>The Harbour of Plymouth consists of three distinct parts,
the Sound, entirely exposed to the violence of south and
south-western winds, and two inner harbours, Catwater and
Hamoaze; the former adapted only for small vessels; and
Hamoaze rendered utterly inaccessible in bad weather by
a ridge of rocks extending from Drake’s Island to the
western shore, thus restricting the only passage to a narrow
and winding channel round that Island under the
Hoe, and between Mount Edgcumbe and the Point.</p>

<p>To remedy this most essential defect, by making a safe
anchorage in the outer harbour, an immense work was
commenced in August 1812, which should be called the
Artificial Reef, from its close resemblance to a natural
reef, and from its having been avowedly planned in imitation
of the coral reefs, abounding near all the Islands in
the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>The Plymouth reef consists of a middle part a thousand
yards long, and lying directly across the entrance of the
Sound, and of two wings bending inwards at a small
angle, each 350 yards long, making in all 1700 yards, or
very nearly a mile. Advantage having been taken of a shoal,
the depth under low water averages about 36 feet, and the
height above low water is just 20 feet. The slope towards
the sea forms an angle of 22° with the horizon, giving an increase
of breadth of nearly two feet and a half for each foot
of descent; the slope towards the land forms an angle of
33° with the horizon, and increases one foot and a half for
each foot of descent: consequently the increase of breadth
on the whole is four feet for one of descent. The whole
<!--115.png--><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a><span class="pageno">109</span>
mass is composed of stones blown by the force of gunpowder
from limestone rocks on the river side, from whence
they are rolled at once on board barges, which sail to the
spot and drop them into sea.</p>

<p>The whole weight of the reef is estimated at 2,500,000
tons. It may be curious to compare it with the largest
building in the world. The Great Pyramid of Egypt measures
687 feet on each of its four sides, and the perpendicular
height is 480 feet; these dimensions, supposing the
Pyramid to be solid, give a content of 76,500,000 cubic
feet, and a weight exceeding 5,500,000 tons, more than
double the weight of the reef, and the materials are large
blocks hewn into regular forms, transported from a considerable
distance by land carriage, then raised into the air,
and finally laid with cement in their exact places.</p>

<p>The artificial reef has cost a million of money; the Pyramid
must have required an amount of labour represented
at present by perhaps twenty times that sum, a building
without use or beauty, while the reef has made Plymouth
one of the best harbours in the whole world.</p>

<p>Maker measures 1867 statute acres. If the artificial arrangement
were attended to, 967 acres must be deducted.</p>

of Kerryer, and hath upon the north <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s,
east Haylford harbour, south <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony, west Mawgan,
and Cury. For the modern name it signifies Monk the,
or the Monk, so called in memory perhaps of some religious
monk or monks that had a convent or abbey in this place.</p>

<p>In the Domesday Book, 1087, this district is not named,
neither can I tell under what jurisdiction it was then taxed,
unless Lizart, or Leschell, which latter may be a corruption
of Kestell; neither is the name Manackan Church of
any great antiquity, for in the Inquisition of the Bishops
of Lincoln and Winchester, into the value of Cornish Benefices,
1294, Ecclesia de Minster, in decanatu de Kerryer,
(which is now called Manackan) is rated £4, but in Wolsey’s
Inquisition, 1521, it is called Manackan, and valued
£4. 16<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 0½<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> The patronage in the Bishop of Exon;

<p><!--117.png--><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a><span class="pageno">111</span>
However to the 15th of the Clergy, 24 Henry 6, it was
rated, then by the name of Minster Church, £1. 4<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 6<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span>
afterwards abated by the name of Minster 6<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> (Carew’s
Survey of Cornwall, page 95.) And lastly Manacan, as
aforesaid; by both which names it is evident that heretofore
there was some abbey or religious house of monks in this
place or parish, wherein God was served with a minister;
<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> vocal or instrumental music in time of divine service,
as that appellation in British implies. And of this place
we further read, (Carew’s Survey of Cornwall, page 46,)
the 12th Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> its revenues was rated for twelve
Cornish acres of land, that is to say, seven hundred and
twenty statute acres; in that book, page 44, that the Bishop
of Exeter held by tenure of knight service, in Minster in
Kerrier, half a knight’s fee of land, 3 Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>; probably
this Minster was some alien monastery or priory, subjected
to some abbey beyond the seas, as many others were
in this land, all dissolved by Act of Parliament, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr>
Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> and Henry <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> for transmitting the secrets of
the State to their superior house aforesaid, in the French
Wars; for which reason perhaps it is not mentioned in the
Monasticon Anglicanum, 26 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> when other
religious houses were dissolved; neither for the like reasons
are <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neot’s, Lancells, or <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Benet’s in Lanyvet, which
I take to be those three abbeys or priories mentioned by
Dugdale and Speed to have been dissolved in Cornwall,
the value of whose revenues they do not set down, but
saith they were Black Monks of the Angells, for Black
Monks of the Augustines.</p>

<p>Moreover, let it be remembered that Manack is also a
glove in British, and Manackan signifies the glove.</p>

<p>Kes-tell, id est, a castle, probably the Reschell in the
Domesday Book aforesaid, in this parish, so called from
some British camp, intrenchment, or fortification, formerly
upon the lands thereof, or contiguous therewith, on the
sea-coast, gave name and original to an old family of gentlemen
now in possession thereof, surnamed de Kestell;

<p>The ancient name of this parish was Minster, which
every one knows doth signify in Saxon a monastery, and
from thence most commonly a church, and so it is called in
the Taxatio Beneficiorum 20 Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr></p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The ancient name of this parish, Minster, and the more
recent one Manac-an, conspire to point it out as the locality
of some religious establishment, since Manack is the Cornish
word identical with Monk, and evidently from the same
root, while an is the article, but although adjectives in all
the Celtic dialects are placed after the substantive, yet the
article regularly precedes it, and this inversion throws
some doubt on the meaning of the compound word, more
especially as not the slightest trace exists of any monastic
institution within this parish in any authentic record, nor
does tradition point out a spot where the foundation of a
building can be perceived.</p>

<p>There is not any thing worth remarking about the
church; it is pleasantly situated, and surrounded by a
neat church town. The vicarage house is good; it was
honoured by the residence, during some years, of our distinguished
poet, historian, and divine, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Richard
Polwhele, till he resigned it for Newlyn, a better living,
<!--119.png--><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a><span class="pageno">113</span>
most properly bestowed on him by Dr. Carey, then Bishop
of Exeter.</p>

<p>The only other village of consequence in this parish is
Helford, where is a passage across the river, of greater
breadth than any other in Cornwall, and various branches
of trade are conducted at this place.</p>

<p>Kestell was formerly the seat of a family giving or deriving
their name from this place; their arms, Or, three
castles Gules, may still be seen over the entrance to the
house. The property now belongs to Lemon of Carclew.</p>

<p>Halvose was for many years the summer residence of
Mr. Thomas Hawkins, of Helston; it belongs at present
to the family of Grylls.</p>

<p>Marham Church rectory, called Marwyn Church, Marwon
Church, in some old books and manuscripts, is situate
in the hundred of Stratton, and hath upon the north Stratton
parish, east Bridgerule and the Tamer river, south
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary Wick, west Poundstock. For the name, it signifies
without doubt the house, home, habitation, or church-dwelling
(for so the words Mar and Ham do signify in the
British, Armorican, and Scottish tongues); and by the
name of Mar-om-cerch it was taxed in the Domesday book
20 William <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 1087, from whence it appears here was a
famous endowed rectory church before the Norman Conquest;
for vicarage churches, especially in Cornwall, sprung
not up till after that time. The first of those appropriations
of the advowsons of churches that I find on
record in England, is that of William the Conqueror’s,
anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 1070, who by charter granted the patronages
or advowsons of the churches of Feversham and Middleton
in Kent to the abbey of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austin’s in Canterbury, in
these words:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Donatio Domini Regis Willielmi Anglorum de Ecclesiis
Feveresham et de Middeltone.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“In nomine sancte et individue Trinitatis, Patris et
Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. Ego Willielmus ineffabili

concedo ecclesiæ Sancti Augustini Anglorum Apostoli,
que sita est in suburbio urbis Cantuarie, pro salute anime
mee, et parentum meorum, predecessorum, et successorum

mellis et gabbi-denariorum. Hec omnia ex integro concedo
sancto Augustino et Abbati et fratribus, ut habeant,

optimatibus.”</p>

<p>Which grant was afterwards confirmed by Pope Alexander
the Third, and ratified by Theobald Archbishop of
Canterbury, together with an establishment and ordination
of a vicarage by the said archiepiscopal authority in
each of the said churches respectively. Afterwards King
Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> 1349, appropriated to the same Abbey three
other church advowsons, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Wivelsberge, Stone, and
Brockland in Kent, ratified and confirmed by Pope Clement
the Fifth’s bull, and by Simon Mepham, then Archbishop
of Canterbury, with the establishment of three perpetual
vicarages in those churches.</p>

<p>Of these sort of vicarage churches appropriated to
Bishops, Deans, and Chapters, Abbots, Colleges, and
Priories, there are in England about three thousand eight
hundred and forty-five, in Cornwall one hundred and
twenty-two; most of them endowed with glebe lands and
small tithes, except about fifteen of them wholly impropriate,
the vicar subsisting only on a small salary or stipend
by custom or subscription.</p>

from the last it has descended to Trefusis.</p>

<p>That the manor of Walesborough gave name to an ancient

Carminow, and Botreaux; that it subsequently came into
the possession of a Rolle, and now belongs to the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>

<p>Wood-Knowle was formerly the residence of the Rolles,
probably of the branch which came possessed of Hilton;

the inhabitants for foreign and domestic trades and merchandizes
to be imported and exported, to their no small
advantage. In which town of East Looe there is a chapel
or oratory for divine service, wherein the rector of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s,
or his curate, officiates on Sundays for convenience
of its inhabitants. It was of old a privileged manor by
prescription, all which was confirmed by a charter from
Queen Elizabeth, the 29th year of her reign, whereby it
was also incorporated by the name of the Mayor and free
Burgesses, consisting of a Mayor and eight chief Burgesses
or Council, the two Members of Parliament elected by the
majority of them. It is also privileged with administration
of justice within the liberties or precincts thereof, as also
with a market on Saturday weekly, and fairs on the <abbr title="second">2d</abbr> of
February and the 29th of September yearly.</p>

<p>The arms of this town are a gallot (high ship) in the sea,
rigged with ropes and yard, bearing three escutcheons,
each charged with the arms of De Bodrugan.</p>

Court Leet of East Looe, to a superior; and the precept

<p>Mr. Tonkin has not any thing relative to this parish or
town, but a long quotation from Browne Willis, wholly
uninteresting; and a conjecture that the chapel at Looe is
dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kenna, usually pronounced <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kayne,
adding as a confirmation, that her festival is kept on the
30th of September, and that on the eve of that day a fair
is established in the town.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>It will be unnecesary to enter on any details respecting
either <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s parish or Looe, since every thing curious
or interesting may be found in a most excellent work:
“Topographical and Historical Sketches of the Boroughs
of East and West Looe, in the County of Cornwall, with an
account of the Natural and Artificial Curiosities, and Picturesque
Scenery of the Neighbourhood. By Thomas
Bond, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> London, printed by and for J. Nichols and
Son, 25, Parliament Street.”</p>

<p>Since Mr. Bond’s work was published, both Looes have
lost the privilege of sending Members to Parliament; and
it is said that a spirit of active exertion has already superseded
the listless reliance on patronage which used to characterize
small borough towns.</p>

<p>A canal has also been constructed to Leskeard, since the
time of Mr. Bond’s publication, promising to diffuse cultivation
and fertility over districts previously inaccessible to
manure; and now at its commencement the canal transports
coal, lime, and other bulky commodities, to such an
extent as to amply repay the sums expended on its formation.</p>

<p>Another plan of a great work is in agitation, likely to
render this beautiful and romantic neighbourhood the resort
of strangers from all parts of the kingdom. Cornwall
is stretched out into the sea by an interrupted chain of
granite hills, extending from Dartmoor to the Land’s End.
<!--127.png--><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a><span class="pageno">121</span>
The valleys follow a general course on either side, transverse
to the granite chain; so that to avoid the perpetual recurrence
of steep declivities, the main road has been carried
along the middle line, above the formation of the valleys,
or, as it is termed, on the backbone of the ridge, over a
most uncultivated and dreary tract.</p>

<p>It is now proposed, in consequence of the safe conveyance
at all times by steam across the Tamar river from
Plymouth, and in humble imitation of the road connecting
France and Italy by the maritime Alps, to convey a new
line of road along the face of the cliffs, over the debouches
of the vallies, and across the Looe and Fowey rivers on
lofty bridges, thus to avoid the hills, and to shorten the distance
nine miles between Tor Point and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell; but
the very large expense may possibly defeat the execution
of a plan, which, in addition to the essential advantages
already stated, would lead travellers to Falmouth, or to
any part of the west of Cornwall, through a district as
beautiful, as that which the road now traverses is unsightly
and uncouth.</p>

<p>The situation of East Looe is at once singular and pleasing.
The two rivers, uniting about half a mile above the
bridge, expand into a lake, loch, or low, evidently bestowing
its name on the towns, and are then contracted into comparatively
a narrow channel by the near approach of two
steep hills. A beach has nevertheless been formed on the
eastern and least precipitous side, by the meeting of the
sea with the descending stream; and on this beach, secured
by artificial mounds, and on the slope of the hill, East Looe
is built.</p>

<p>Perhaps the only other addition that I can make to Mr.
Bond’s work is to state that he himself has been the chief
ornament of Looe for many years past, and that his ancestors
may be found among the mayors and aldermen of the
corporation, up to the period when the charter was given
to the town.</p>

<p><!--128.png--><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a><span class="pageno">122</span>
Mr. Hals has detailed at great length the history of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Martin of Tours, the undoubted patron of this parish.</p>

<p>It may be sufficient to state a few particulars of this far-famed
personage. He was born in Hungary, of parents
elevated in life, and commenced his early career in the
Roman army, but afterwards became an ecclesiastic, having
obtained celebrity, influence, and power, by adopting the
most baneful of all practical heresies, founded on a belief
that the favour of the Almighty may be effectually obtained
by reversing the order established by his Divine Providence,
and bestowing on idleness, profligacy, and vice,
the legitimate rewards of industry, frugality, and care; in
consequence, he became the favourite of rogues, thieves,
vagrants, and impostors, and has continued so in Catholic
countries to the present time. A part of his high reputation
has however been derived from a more pure source.
He supported the orthodox faith against the Arians, who at
that period are supposed to have more than numerically
divided the Christian Church.</p>

<p>The most absurd and ridiculous legends are related of
this Saint by his disciple <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Sulpicius, and by other writers.
In one of these it is said that our Saviour himself appeared
to him on a cold winter’s night, under the disguise of a half
naked wandering beggar; and that Martin, then a soldier,
not having any thing else to bestow, divided his cloak with
a sword, and gave one portion of it to the supposed
mendicant. In another, setting at defiance the precept
“Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God,” he allowed
himself to be fastened with cords, immediately under the
inclining trunk of a tree, as workmen were dividing the
roots; but just as the tree was about to fall on him, he
signed it with the sign of the cross, when instantly the
trunk ascended, and reached the ground in an opposite direction.
Raising people from the dead, and resisting
personal temptations of the devil, appear to have been frequent
and ordinary occurrences. He died at Tours, in the
odour of sanctity, in the year 397, having held the bishoprick
<!--129.png--><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a><span class="pageno">123</span>
26 years. The festival in honour of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin is
kept on the 11th of November, but parish feasts are not
observed in the eastern parts of Cornwall.</p>

<p>The advowson of this living, appurtenant to the manor
of Pendrym, came to the family of Paulet, through the
same succession as that which brought Ludgvan Lease, including
the high lordship of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives; and a peculiar although
well-known relationship having continued to exist
between the two properties, the learned Mr. Jonathan
Toup was translated from the borough town to this rectory
in the year 1751, where he died, <abbr title="January">Jan.</abbr> 19, 1785. A
monument has been erected to Mr. Toup’s memory by the
Delegates of the Oxford Press, and he is there related to
have been born in <abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr> 1713. Mr. Toup has been mentioned
under <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, the place of his birth.</p>

<p>There are other monuments:&mdash;to Walter Langdon, of
Keveril, stated to be the last of his race; to Philip Maiowe,
probably ancestor of John Mayo, or Mayow, M.D. Fellow
of All Souls College, Oxford, and afterwards Physician at
Bath<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span>
; also to the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Stephen Midhope, sometime Rector
of this parish, who died in the year 1636; but this gentleman,
hurried away by the whirl of fanatical opinions, growing
out of the Reformation, had resigned his living some
years before, on professing himself an Anabaptist.</p>

<p>This parish measures 2,719 statute acres.</p>

<p>Tremayne, that is the town of stone, or the stone
town, in this parish, is the dwelling of an old family of
<!--131.png--><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a><span class="pageno">125</span>
gentlemen, surnamed Thoms or Tomys, Anglice Thomas;
so called after the Cornish-British manner, after the
font name of some of their ancestors. Of which family
was Robert Thomy, who held by the tenure of knight’s
service half a knight’s fee at Bliston, in Trigshire, now
Blissland, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> (Mr. Carew’s Survey of
Cornwall, page 42). Also one little knight’s fee at Carnanton,
in Pedyr, idem liber, page 43. The present
posssessor is &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Thoms, and giveth for his arms,
in a field Argent, a chevron between three talbots Sable.
From this family, as I am informed, by younger brothers
sprang, from their dwellings at Carveth and Carnsew in
Mabe, and Roscrow in Gluvias, three families, who were
transnominated after the names of those places, from
Thoms to Carveth, and Roscrow, and Carnsew, who in
testimony thereof ever gave their arms as aforesaid as
Thoms did.</p>

<p>Mudgan in this parish, is the corruption of Muchan, as
I  take it, which signifies a short chimney,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_4" id="fnanchor_4"></a><a href="#footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span>
 with a lovour
or chimney-hole through the top of the house for the
smoke. From whence was denominated a family of gentlemen,
surnamed Mugaun, or Mudgan, whose sole inheritrix
was married to Chynoweth, of Chynoweth, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Earth, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Queen Mary, that is new house, so called
from a new house, the first of this name, built in that
parish, when he parted with his old lands and name of
Trevillizik there, (now Tre-liz-ik) which signifies the water
gulf, creek, town, as situate upon the sea banks or cliff,
which affords a bad passage over the Hayle river, at low
water, for passengers on foot or horseback. The last gentleman
of this family, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Anthony Chynoweth, that married
Trevillian, dying without issue, his brother John Chynoweth’s
three daughters, by Lannar, succeeded to his
estate and became his heirs; who were married to Banfeild,
Dunscomb, and Trelevan, lately in possession of

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>This parish presents very little worthy of notice except
Tremayne, which gave origin to both branches of the honourable
and respected family, which flourished at Sydenham
in Devonshire, and at Heligan in this county. The
place is situated on the southern bank of Helford river.
Mr. Lysons states that it passed with an heiress from the
family of Tremayne to Reskymer. It has been frequently
sold in recent times.</p>

<p>Mr. Hals mentions a Nunnery at a farm in this parish,
called Hellnoweth, which Mr. Lysons says did belong to
the Monastery of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount; but there is not
the slightest trace to be found in any authentic work of a
separate establishment having ever existed there; although
Mr. Hals is so confident of it, as fancifully to derive the
word Meneage from Menales, a supposed appellation of
the nuns. All the parishes in the Lizard district, bounded
by the Helford River and the Looe Pool, are said to be in
Meneage, although no such division is recognised for any
civil or ecclesiastical purpose. Under a supposition that
this parish might be dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin, pope and
martyr, Mr. Hals has given his history at great length,
<!--133.png--><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><span class="pageno">127</span>
which is omitted as being wholly uninteresting, as well as
irrelevant, since the parish feast is kept on the nearest
Sunday to <abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> the 11th, the well-known festival of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Martin of Tours. Some notice is taken of this Pope
under Gulval, where he is honoured as the patron Saint.

<p>This district of Meneage is a kind of peninsula, formed
between the lakes or rivers Looe and Hayle, conjoined at
the neck only by a little part of this parish of Mawgan
with that of Gwendron and Helleston; from whence further
south in length and breadth, the land shooteth in towards
the British Ocean, in the several parishes of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s,
Manaccan, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony, Kevorne, Ruan Major, Ruan
Minor, Landawednack, Grade, Cury, Mullyan, Gonwallo.
Which peninsula is further notable for its great fertility
between the rocks for corn and grass; for as at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kevorne
and other parishes, if wheat corn be seasonably tilled
and well manured, it will produce commonly in the beginning
of July a harvest of twenty bushels Cornish measure,
that is to say sixty bushels Winchester to a Cornish
acre of land; so in like manner this neck of land, being
the most south-west part of this island of Britain, and
situate between two seas, will in ten weeks time after the
sowing of barley, produce a harvest in many places of much
greater increase than that of wheat aforesaid. Moreover,
it is also profitable for breeding and feeding bullocks and
sheep of all sorts; and particularly Gon-hilly Downs, id est
the Hunting Downs, is notable for the breed of an under-statute
sort of mares and horses, swift and sure of foot, and
of great strength and hardiness for travel and labour.
Which Downs consist of many hundred acres of land, all
overspread with grey cloos, or a kind of marble stones as
aforesaid.</p>

<!--135.png--><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><span class="pageno">129</span>
in this parish, words of one import, is the rockhill

circumstances of the place, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> lands situate upon the rocks
and hills abutting upon the sea-cliff of the British channel,
and the Looe creek or cove therof. I know, contrary
to this etymology, Mr. Carew tells us that Carminow is a
little city, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 55 Surv. Cornwall. But Caer-Vyan, or
Caer-Byan, or Vyan-Caer, is a little city in Cornish; Caer-Broas,
Bruse, a great, large, or extensive city. Again,
page 142, he tells us that the interpretation of Car-mynow
is often-loving; from which contradictory or cross etymology
of this compound word aforesaid, it is evident he knew
very little of the language of our ancestors the Britons, as
his successor Mr. Camden did much less.</p>

<p>This local place gave name and original to an old British
family of gentlemen surnamed de Carmynow, now extinct,
who flourished there for many generations in great fame
and riches; in particular here lived Robert de Carmynow,

who was summoned by writ, 48 Henry <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> to come and
take his degree of knighthood. (Carew’s Survey of Cornwall,

Sheriff of Cornwall 2 Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> 1379. Betwixt
whom and the Lord Richard Scrope, of Bolton Castle,
in Richmondshire, Lord Chancellor of England <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Edward
<abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> (father of William Lord Scrope, Earl of Wiltshire
and Lord Treasurer of England 21 Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> and
Knight of the Garter, beheaded at Bristol for attainder
of treason against Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr>. 1399,) happened
a memorable trial in the Court of Chivalry, or Earl Marshal’s
Court, about the bearing on their shields, or coat
armour, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Azure, a bend Or.</p>

<p>In this action the Lord Scrope was plaintiff, who declared
that he was lineally descended from one Scrope, a
<!--136.png--><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a><span class="pageno">130</span>
French or Norman soldier, that came over into England
under the banner and conduct of William the Conqueror,
against King Harold, anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 1066; and that he gave
for his arms, (portoit) d’Azur, à la band d’Or; and that
his posterity till that instant (1360) ever gave the same
arms, and to corroborate this their bearing, they produced
a copy of the record thereof in the Earl Marshal’s Court;
therefore Mr. Carmenow’s thus assuming and bearing
their proper arms, it was contrary to law, and equity, and
arms.</p>

<p>To this declaration the defendant pleaded not guilty, and
in justification of the bearing aforesaid, said that his ancestors
were Cornish Britons; and lived at Carmenow long
before the Norman Conquest; and particularly, that one of
them was sent by King Edward the Confessor an ambassador,
either to the French King or Duke of Normandy;
who gave those arms in and for his device, or shield; and
that from that time to the time of King Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> aforesaid,
which was about three hundred years, his posterity
had ever given or borne the same arms, without interruption
or alteration.</p>

<p>To this the plaintiff rejoined, that there was then no such
public record extant in the Office of Arms, or Marshal’s
Court, that appropriated any such bearing to this name
or family of Carmenow, neither was the Provincial Herald
called Clarencieux, for granting arms and recording the
descents of private gentlemen for the south-west part of
England, instituted but just before this action; and therefore,
if the said Ralph Carmenow, or his ancestors, gave
those arms, they were only personal badges or devices that
terminated with their lives, and could not be hereditary or
descend to posterity. And further it was alleged that in
case Carmenow’s ancestor lived at Carmenow before the
Norman Conquest, those arms could not be appropriated
to him by the name of de Carmenow, for it was not the
custom of the Britons till about a hundred years after, to
style themselves from local places with the Latin pronoun
<!--137.png--><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a><span class="pageno">131</span>
or particle, De, after the manner of the French. But before
were generally distinguished by the names John Mac
Richard, Richard Mac Thomas, Robert ap Ralph, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
that is to say the son of Thomas, Robert, and Ralph, according
to their lineal descents.</p>

<p>Whereupon, after a full view and hearing of what could
be said and shown on either part, by learned council as to
records, manuscripts, deeds and pedigrees, the Earl Marshal,
in Westminster Hall, gave judgment for the plaintiff;
and the definitive sentence was afterwards made and signed
with the public seal of that Court, and read in open audience;
and orders given to the Sub-Marshal to put the same
in execution; which was, that Carmenow should never more
give the arms aforesaid without a label of three points Gules
for a distinction; when accordingly the same was first entered
of record in Clarencieux, or the Provincial Herald’s
books, as the subsequent hereditary coat armour of his
family, (and as tradition saith Carmenow paid costs,) which
rule was ever after by those gentlemen observed in their
bearings.</p>

<p>And though Carmenow’s friends pleased themselves in
this distinction of a label, because given by the Emperor
of Rome’s son and heir whilst his father was alive; and for
that it is the mark or cognizance of the eldest son and heir
of a family of the greatest degree; yet it is manifest Carmenow
himself was so distasted therewith, that he chose for
the motto of this new bearing arms, a Cornish sentence
which abundantly expressed his dislike thereof: Cala rag
Ger da, id est, a straw for fame, or breath.</p>

<p>William Carmenow, his son and heir, married the sole
daughter and heir of Rawleigh, of Smallridge, in Devon,
and was Sheriff of that County 14th of Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>; he
had issue by her Thomas Carmenow, Sheriff of Cornwall
2 Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> He or his son was also Sheriff of Cornwall the
8th of Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>; who had issue William Carmenow,
father of John, whose daughters and heirs were married to
Arundell of Lanherne, and Sir John Reskymer, of Reskymer,
<!--138.png--><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a><span class="pageno">132</span>
Knight. This John Carmenow suffered the barton
and manor of Carmenow, with other lands, to go in marriage
with his two daughters and heirs, married as aforesaid;
whilst the greatest part of his ancient estate, by virtue of
the entail, after his decease descended to his younger brother,
John Carmenow, of Fentongollan, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Sheriff of
Cornwall 5 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr></p>

<p>In this local place of Carmenow those gentlemen had
their ancient domestic chapel and burying place, the walls
and windows whereof are still to be seen; in which place
also formerly stood the tombs and funeral monuments of
divers once notable persons of this family; of which sort, in
the beginning of King James the First’s reign, when this
chapel was left to run to ruin and decay, the inhabitants of
this parish of Mawgan, out of respect to the memory of
those gentlemen, brought from thence two funeral monuments
in human shape, at full length, made of alabaster,
freestone, or marble, man and woman I take it, curiously
wrought and cross-legged, with two lions couchant under
their feet, and deposited or lodged them in this parish
church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mawgan, where they are yet to be seen,
though the inscriptions and coat armour thereof are now
obliterated and defaced by time. Now, though it was the
custom to form the funeral monuments of such as had been
in the Holy War <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Richard <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> and Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> cross-legged,
yet I find that posture of monuments for the dead
was much more ancient, and placed on the tombs of such
as had never been in the Holy War, in memory of the
cross whereon our Blessed Saviour suffered for our redemption
and salvation. Lastly, it is further observable
of this family of Carmenow, that, notwithstanding their
great estate, gentility, and antiquity, they never had any
higher title of honour or dignity conferred upon them by
our English Kings than that of Knights Bachelors, of which
sort two or three of them had been knights. This family
was possest of five knight’s fees of land <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>;
<!--139.png--><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a><span class="pageno">133</span>
in Trewint, in Lesnewith, also in Moteland there, also in
Hernecoft in Stratton hundred, also in Merthyn and Winenton
in Kerrier; by computation four thousand acres of
land of this tenure. (See Carew’s Survey of Cornwall.)</p>

<p>Res-ky-mer, in this parish, was the seat of Rogerus de
Reskymer, a military man or officer for conduct of the
new levies for France, 15 Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> (Survey of Cornwall,
page 52.)</p>

<p>Richardus de Reskymer, probably his son, was one of
those forty-nine Cornish gentlemen that held lands by the
tenure of knight service, or grand sergeanty, by attending
the King personally in his wars, with a horse and arms furnished
according to his degree. See the writ directed to
the Sheriff of Cornwall for that purpose, commanding him
to attend him in his wars in France, 25 Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> (Carew’s
Survey of Cornwall, page 51.) He held by the same
tenure above £20 lands per annum.</p>

<p>John Reskymer married Alice, the second daughter and
heir of John Densill, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Sergeant-at-Law, about the year
1508, and had issue by her Sir John Reskymer, Knight,
that married &mdash;&mdash; one of the coheirs of John Carmenow,
of Carmenow, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Sheriff of Cornwall 31 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>;
who had issue by her, as I am informed, John Reskymer,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Sheriff of Cornwall 3 and 4 of Queen Mary; who
married Seyntaubyn, by whom he had issue only four
daughters, that became his heirs; married to Trelawney
of Poole, Lower of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Wenow, Vyvyan of Trelowarren,
and Courtenay of Trethyrfe; in whose families the name,
blood, and estate of those Reskymers are terminated;
though now this Reskimer barton is the lands and possessions
of Pendarves of Roscrow, as I am informed, and purchased
by Mr. Basset, who gave for their arms, in allusion
to part of their name, in a field Azure three bars
Argent, in chief a wolf or wild dog passant of the First.</p>

<p>Tre-lo-warren, alias Talla-warren. In this place, as
appears from Mr. Carew’s Survey of Cornwall, page 42,
<!--140.png--><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><span class="pageno">134</span>
3 Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> one Mathew de Trethake held by tenure of
knight service half a knight’s fee of land, from whose heir
I suppose it came by purchase or marriage to Ferrers;
but whether those gentlemen were descended from the
Ferrers of Tutbury Castle, in Staffordshire, whose ancestor
came out of France, a collateral under William the Conqueror,
1066, (who gave for his arms, sex ferres de cheval
de Sable,) or from the Ferrers of Newton Ferrers, in the
county of Devon, (who gave for their arms, Argent, a bend
Gules, and a chief Vert,) I know not. However, there is
yet extant, in the stone wall of the tower of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mawgan,
cut in chief in the same, the 1st the arms of Carmenow,
<abbr title="second">2d</abbr> of Reskymer, <abbr title="third">3d</abbr> Ferrers, 4th Vyvyan; by which arms
this family may be distinguished.</p>

<p>Originally the Vyvyans were possessed of Trevederne in
Buryan, as they still are; and from thence matched with
the daughter and heir of Skyburiow, afterwards with the
daughter and heir of Ferrers of Trelowarren; which first
brought those lands into the possession of Vyvyan; particularly
as I am informed Richard Vyvyan, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Sheriff of
Cornwall 9 Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> 1494; Richard Vyvyan, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> his
son, was Sheriff of Cornwall 20 Henry VIII; Michael
Vyvyan, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> was Sheriff of Cornwall 22 of Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>;
Hanniball Vyvyan, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> was Sheriff of Cornwall 43 of
Elizabeth; whose son, Frances Vyvyan, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> afterwards
knighted, was Sheriff of Cornwall 15 James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> who built
the house now extant at Trelowarren, and married one of
the coheirs of Vyell, of Trevorder. His son, Richard
Vyvyan, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> afterwards, 12 February 1644, by King
Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> was created the 384th Baronet of England,
married Bulteel, and had issue by her Sir Vyell Vyvyan,
Baronet, afterwards knighted by King Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>; who
married Thomasin, daughter and heir of James Robins, of
Penryn, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> Attorney-at-Law, who died without issue;
afterwards he married Jane, daughter of Thomas Melhuish,
of Penryn, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> the relict of Michael Cood, but
<!--141.png--><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a><span class="pageno">135</span>
died without issue that lived. Note that the name Melhuish
is local, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> from the barton or tenement of Melhuish,
near Kirton in Devon, which signifies a lark-bird,
or larks, as alauda.</p>

<p>After Sir Vyell Vyvyan’s decease, his nephew Sir Richard
Vyvyan, Baronet, that succeeded to his estate and
honour, son and heir of Charles Vyvyan, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Barrister-at-Law,
(younger brother of Sir Vyell aforesaid) by Erisey, married
Mary, daughter and heir of Francis Vivian, of Cosowarth,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> by Anne, daughter and heir of Henry Mynors,
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Enedor, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> by Bridget, the only surviving child
of Sir Samuel Cosowarth, Knight, and sole heir to her
brother Nicholas Cosowarth, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> that died without issue
<abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> By the which Mary Vyvian, his lady,
Sir Richard is now in possession of Cosowarth and Vivian’s
lands.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Vyvyan, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> first mentioned, had also
issue by Bulteel five daughters, married to Robinson, Trewren,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The arms of this family are in a field Argent, a lion
rampant Gules.</p>

<p>Mr. Tonkin has not any thing of the least consequence
different from Mr. Hals.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>It is curious that this parish should have afforded residences
to three families so distinguished as Carminow,
Reskymer, and Vyvyan. The two first have been long
extinct; Vyvyan still continues one of the first in Cornwall.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Vyvyan, mentioned by Mr. Hals, adhered
to what was thought by many in those days to be the good
old cause of the Cavaliers and the Restoration of Charles
the Second; and in consequence King George the First
<!--142.png--><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><span class="pageno">136</span>
and his ministry, excusing themselves perhaps by the authority,</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Res dura, et regni novitas me talia cogunt
     Moliri,</p>

<p class="unindent">not only removed all their suspected opponents from the
commission of the peace, and from places of trust, but committed
several to prison. Among others Sir Richard Vyvyan,
who was seized in his house at Trelowarren, conveyed
by water to Pendennis Castle, and removed from thence to
the Tower.</p>

<p>A story is related of a king’s messenger having been detained
at an inn called Hallworthy, east of Camelford,
while an adherent reached Trelowarren, and enabled Sir
Richard Vyvyan to destroy many documents, which might
have proved his being adverse, as well as many other Cornish
gentlemen, to the new government.</p>

<p>As the persons then in power failed of being able to
prove any overt acts taken against themselves, they were
obliged to discharge this gentleman out of custody; but
not till he had a daughter, Ann Vyvyan, born in the
Tower, whom the Editor well remembers; and Sir Richard
Vyvyan was, as a matter of course, chosen one of the representatives
for the county at the next election, which
situation he had however held in some former Parliaments.</p>

<p>He married Mary, only daughter and heir of Vyvyan of
Cosowarth, in the parish of Little Colan, and left a numerous
family.</p>

<p>His eldest son, Vyel Vyvyan, married Mary, daughter
and heiress of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Carew Hoblyn, and left two sons,
Richard, who married Jane, daughter of Christopher Hawkins,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Trewinnard, and of Mary, coheiress of the
Hawkinses of Penzance:&mdash;they had not any family; and
Carew the second son, a clergyman, never married.</p>

<p>Richard, the second son of Sir Richard Vyvyan, married
the heiress of the family of Piper, and settled at their
seat called <a name="err_8" id="err_8"></a>Modford, almost in the town of Launceston.
<!--143.png--><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a><span class="pageno">137</span>
Their eldest son Philip, married Mary, the daughter and
heiress of Sheldon Walter, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> and through her mother
heiress of the Medlands, of Tremail, in South Petherwin.
Their son, Vyel, succeeded to the family estate, and having
married Mary, daughter of Thomas Hutton Rawlinson, of
Lancaster, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> has been succeeded by his eldest son, Sir
Richard Rawlinson Vyvyan, of whom it may be sufficient
to say, that, having been very early in life elected member
for the county of Cornwall, he so distinguished himself in
Parliament as to receive an invitation from all the leading
gentlemen of Bristol, to represent their city, when a difference
of political opinion severed him from the constituent
body of Cornwall, and that he has twice obtained the
honour of being elected Member for the second city in
England.</p>

<p>Trelowarren alone remains of the seats in this parish,
and it amply compensates for the disappearance of the
others. No place in the county, excepting perhaps Penhale
in Egloskerry, comes into comparison with Trelowarren,
as a gentleman’s residence in the style of former times.
The house is believed to be more ancient than the time
assigned to it by Mr. Hals, and that Mr. Francis Vyvyan
only repaired and possibly enlarged a building at the least
as old as the possession of the Ferrers. Sir Richard Vyvyan
almost entirely reconstructed the interior of the
house, soon after the year 1750, and great improvements
have been made by the present proprietor, and by his
father. Doctor Borlase has given a view of the house,
page 86 of his Natural History.</p>

<p>The manor of Carminow continued long in the family of
Arundell: it is now by purchase the property of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
John Rogers.</p>

<p>A detailed account of the curious trial before the judges
of the Court of Chivalry, and ultimately before the King
himself in person, relative to the arms borne by the Carminows,
has been given in “Anecdotes of heraldry,” published
by a lady about thirty years since. The decision of the
<!--144.png--><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a><span class="pageno">138</span>
King is there stated to be, that each claimant should bear
the arms without differences. The motto given by Mr.
Hals is literally in Cornish, Cala rag ger da, a straw for a
good word.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons, quoting from “The Scrope and Grosvenor
Roll,” another controversy on the same armorial coat, (and
which has been recently published by Sir Harris Nicolas)
notices that testimony was adduced on behalf of the Carminows,
tracing the use of their arms back to the reign of
our renowned King Arthur! To such evidence on armorial
bearings, as Lysons justly remarks, little credit is due.</p>

<p>The church is large, and contains some ancient monuments,
believed to be of the Carminow family, with shields
and other decorations.</p>

<p>The advowson of the living belongs to the Trevelyans,
of Nettlecombe, in Somersetshire, and one of that family is
the incumbent.</p>

<p>In the Domesday Book, 20 William <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 1087, this district
was taxed under the name of Lan-cherit; here was
an endowed rectory, chapel or church before that time; and
the same endowed by the Prior of the Priory of Plympton
(founded by the West Saxon Kings). Afterwards, when
this old church was re-edified and enlarged to the mode and
bulk it now shows, it was then consecrated or dedicated to
the honour of Almighty God, in the name of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mawgan
aforesaid; and this is evidenced from the Inquisitions of
the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester, 1294, into the
value of Benefices, in decanatu de Pidre, Sancti Maugani
£6. 13<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 4<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span>, and the Prior of Plympton received £1. 6<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 8<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span>

<p>From this church is denominated the manor and barton
house of Lanherne, contiguous therewith; which of old was
the lands of Symon Pincerna, id est Butler; so called for that,
as tradition saith, he was butler of the cellar, or waited
upon the cup, bottle, or glass of King Henry <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> and is
mentioned from the Records of the Exchequer, in Mr.
Carew’s Survey of Cornwall, page 45, to have held by the
<!--146.png--><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a><span class="pageno">140</span>
tenure of knight service in Lanherne, one knight’s fee;
which gentleman was also lord of the manor of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James’s
in Middlesex, at Westminster, who exchanged the same
with King Henry <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> or King Henry <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> for the manor
of Conerton, in the parish of Gwythian and hundred of
Penwith in this county; which deeds of conveyance are
yet to be seen at Lanherne.</p>

<p>The issue male of the Pincernas failing, the two daughters
and heirs of his family were married, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>
to Arundell, of Trembleth in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ervan, and Umphravill;
hence it is we read in the Rolls of the Exchequer and

<p>After Arundell’s match with Pincerna’s heir, he removed
to Lanherne, which hath ever since been the seat of that
famous and flourishing family, who derive their name from
John de Arundell, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Henry <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>; since which time (for
about twenty-three descents) they have married with the
inheritrixes of Trembleth, Pincerna, Lamburne, Lescor,
Lanbaddern, Tresithny, Carmenow, Grey, Denham, and
several others; so that by reason of their wealth, or great
estates, the country people heretofore entitled them by the
name of the Great Arundells, (see Mr. Carew’s Survey of
Cornwall, page 144,) though there was a great diminution
of their ancient estate at and after the time that John Arundell,
<abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Queen Mary, married Anne, the daughter of
Sir Henry Gernigan, Knight, Master of the Horse, or Captain
of the Guards to that Queen. However, I take it his
son or grandson, John Arundell, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> married the coheir
of Chydiock, and thereby repaired part of that loss,
and had by her issue John Arundell, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> afterwards
knighted, who married Elizabeth Roper, daughter of the
Lord Teynham, and by her had issue two sons that died
without issue, and Elizabeth, married to Sir Richard
Billinge, knight; &mdash;&mdash; married to Sir Robert Bedingfield,
<!--147.png--><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a><span class="pageno">141</span>
knight; and &mdash;&mdash; that was entered into a monastery
of Benedictine nuns in France, as I am informed.</p>

<p>Sir John Arundell, knight, (my very kind friend,) after
his lady’s decease, took for his second wife &mdash;&mdash; daughter
of John Arundell, of Trerice, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> the relict of John
Trevanion, of Caryhayes, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> by whom he had no issue.
Whereupon the said Sir John Arundell, having by fine,
proclamation, and recovery, docked his estate tail to bar
the remainder, settled the same upon his grandson, Richard
Billinge, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> by his last will and testament; on condition
that he and his posterity for ever should assume the surname
of Arundell, in conjunction with that of Billinge, or
separate, anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 1701.</p>

<p>The first gentleman of this family that appears on public
record to have served the state or the country, was Sir
John Arundell, knight, Sheriff of Cornwall, 6 Henry <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr>
1418, when Stephen Durneford was Sheriff of Devon.
Renfry Arundell, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> his son, was Sheriff of Cornwall 16
Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> 1443, (when one Thomas Arundell was Sheriff
of Devon,) Renfry Arundell, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> was Sheriff of Cornwall
3 and 4 Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> 1483.</p>

<p>John Arundell, son of the said Renfrye, had his first
education in the college of Canons Augustine in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Columb,
partly founded and endowed by his ancestors;
from whence he removed to Exeter College, in Oxford,
where, after he had taken his degrees of Bachelor and
Master of Arts, he was ordained Priest, and presented by
his father to the great rectory of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Columb Major in
Cornwall; and accordingly, had institution and induction
thereto from the Bishop of Exeter; afterwards he was chosen
Dean of Exeter, when Doctor Fox was Bishop thereof,
1490; where after he had sat for some time, upon
the translation of William Smith, Bishop of Lichfield and
Coventry, to Lincoln, (the successor of John Hals, who
died 1492,) he had bestowed upon him by King Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>
that bishoprick, and was consecrated anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 1496;
<!--148.png--><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a><span class="pageno">142</span>
afterwards, upon the death of Dr. Redman, Bishop of
Exeter, 1504, he was translated to that diocese, and was installed
Bishop thereof 1504; where, after he had well governed
that diocese for about two years space, he died at
London, 19 February 1506, and lies buried in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clement’s
Church without Temple Bar.</p>

<p>From this family, by younger branches, were descended,
<abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Richard <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> the knightly family of the Arundells
late of Tolvorne (from whence the writer of those lines
by females is descended); as also the Arundells, late of Trevithick,
in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Columb Major, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Edward <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>; as also
the Baron Arundells of Wardour in Wiltshire, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr>
James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>; as also the Arundells of Gloucestershire, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr>
Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr></p>

<p>Though this family by the name of Arundell is set forth
in Battle Abbey corrupted roll, to have come out of
France with the Conqueror, I take it to be denominated
from Arundell town and castle in Sussex, (for as Sir John
Arundell, the last possessor of Lanherne, told me he could
never understand there was any such local place in France
as Arundell, though he lived long in that country and
made strict inquiry after it,) for Ederick the Saxon was
Earl of Arundell town and castle aforesaid, before William
the Conqueror landed here, who after the death of
King Harold was displaced and disinherited by the Conqueror,
and Roger de Montgomery made Earl thereof in
his place, to whom his estate was given. However,
notwithstanding that this family, out of a supposed allusion
to their name, give for their arms, in a field Sable
six swallows, in pile three, two, and one, Argent or
proper, for that Arond in Gaulish French is a swallow;
now corrupted after the Latin to hirundelle; guenol,
Tisbicock, guenvoll, British: as (<a name="chg_10" id="chg_10"></a>χελιδων hirundo in
Greek) in Armoric guinib is a swallow. Arond in
French, Ar-ran-dell, British, is the lake of water division
valley.</p>

<p><!--149.png--><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><span class="pageno">143</span>
One Bishop of this parish, in his youth, was, after his
school education at Retallock, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Columb Major, in the
Latin and Greek tongues, under Mr. John Coode, that
famous schoolmaster, taken by the cost and care of Sir
John Arundell, of Lanherne, from thence, and placed by
him in Douay College in Flanders, where he took orders
as a Catholic Roman Priest, and afterwards returned into
England, and became house chaplain to the said Sir John
Arundell, knight; and from thence visited and confirmed
the Roman Catholics in those parts for many years, by the
pretended surname of Mr. Gifford; he died at Hammersmith,
near London, 20 March 1733, aged 99 years, and
ordered his body to be opened and his heart to be taken
out, and sent to Douay aforesaid, and kept in spirits, and
his body to be buried in Pancras church, in London.
(London Gazette, 23 March 1733.) He was made Doctor
of Divinity by his College aforesaid, and consecrated
Bishop of &mdash;&mdash;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_5" id="fnanchor_5"></a><a href="#footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span>
 in the Banqueting House at Whitehall,
in the last year of King James <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></p>

<p>Car-nan-ton in this parish, id est, the Rock Valley Town,
was the voke lands of a considerable manor, taxed in the
Domesday Book 1087. As it was then so it is now, a franchise
royal, pertaining in chief to the Crown, invested with
the jurisdiction of a Court Leet within its precincts, and
had lately its steward and bailiff, to attend the public services
in trials at law between party and party, on pleas of
debt and damage; and here Robert Thomye held the fourth
part of a knight’s fee of land, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> as Mr.
Carew informs us.</p>

<p>It was lately the dwelling of William Noye, of Pendrea
in Buryan, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> farmer thereof; who was first bred a
student at law in Lincoln’s Inn; afterwards, having taken
his degrees therein, he was chosen Member of Parliament
for the town of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives in Cornwall, in which capacity he
<!--150.png--><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a><span class="pageno">144</span>
stood for some Parliaments in the beginning of the reign of
King Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> and was specially famous for being one of
the boldest and stoutest champions of the subject’s liberty
in Parliament that the Western parts of England afforded;
which being observed by the Court party, King Charles
was advised by his Cabinet Council that it would be a
prudent course to divert the force and power of Noye’s
skill, logic, and rhetoric another way, by giving him some
Court preferment; whereupon King Charles made him his
Attorney-general, 1631; by which expedient he was soon
metamorphosed from the assertor of the subjects’ liberty
and property to a most zealous and violent promoter, beyond
the laws, of the despotic and arbitrary prerogative or
monarchy of his Prince; so that, like the image of Janus at
Rome, he looked forward and backward, and by means
thereof greatly enriched himself.</p>

<p>Amongst other things he is reflected upon by our chronologers
for being the principal contriver of the Ship-money
tax, laid by King Charles upon his subjects, for
setting forth a navy or fleet of ships at sea, without the
consent of Lords or Commons in Parliament; which
moneys were raised by writ to the Sheriffs of all counties,
and Commissioners for a long time brought into the Exchequer
twenty thousand pounds per mensem, to the great
distaste of the Parliament, the Laity, and Clergy, who declared
against it as an unlawful tax. Nevertheless all the
twelve judges after Noye’s death, except Hutton and Crook,
gave their opinions and hands to the contrary, in Hampden’s
case; <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Branston, Finch, Davenport, Denham,
Jones, Trevor, Vernon, Berkeley, Crawley, and Weston.
(See Baker’s Chronicle, printed 1656.) However, out of
kindness to the clergy, the King wrote to all the Sheriffs
of England, requiring that the clergy, possessed of parsonages
or rectories, should not be assessed above a tenth part
of the land rate of their several parishes, and that regard
should be had to vicars accordingly; by which rule the
quanto or sum of this Ship-money Tax by the month may
<!--151.png--><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a><span class="pageno">145</span>
be calculated. But I shall conclude this paragraph of
Noye in the words of Hammon Le Strange, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> in the
Life of King Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> “Noye became so servilely addicted
to the King’s prerogative, by ferreting up old penal
statutes, and devising new exactions, for the small time he
enjoyed his power, that he was the most pestilent vexation
to the subject that this latter age afforded,” <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> He died
on Saturday, August the 9th 1634, and was buried in the
church of New Brentford, Middlesex, with an inscription
on a stone to this purpose: “Here lyes the body of William
Noye, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> som tyme Atturney Generall to Kinge
Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>” This gentleman writ that excellent book of
the law called Noye’s Reports; he married &mdash;&mdash; and
had issue: Edward Noye, his eldest son, killed in a duel
soon after his father’s death; and Humphrey Noye, his
second son. He married Hester, daughter of the Lord Sands
of Hampshire, and by her had issue two sons, William
Noye and Humphrey Noye, that died without issue, and
Katherine, married to William Davies, gentleman, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Earth; and Bridgman, to John Williams of Rosworthy,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> sometime Commissioner for the Peace, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Queen
Anne, in whose right he is now in possession of this barton
of Carnanton, but by her he had no issue; after her decease
he married Dorothy, daughter of Peter Day, gentleman,
and by her hath issue, and giveth for his arms, in a
field Argent a fess checky Gules and Vert, between three
griffin’s heads erased Vert, each gorged with a ducal crown
Or; the paternal coat armour of the Williams’s, of Dorset
or Wiltshire; his grandfather coming from thence a steward
to the Arundells of Lanherne.</p>

<p>The arms of Noye are: Argent, three bendlets and a
canton Sable, on the canton a cross of the Field; and another,
Azure, three crosses botony in bend Argent.</p>

<p>The Attorney-general on a day, having King Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
and the principal officers and nobility of his Court, at a
dinner at his house in London, at which time the Arch
Poet Ben Jonson, and others, being at an inn on the
<!--152.png--><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><span class="pageno">146</span>
other side the street, and wanting both meat and money
for their subsistence, at that exigent resolved to try an
expedient to get his dinner from the Attorney-general’s
table; in order to which, by his landlord at the inn aforesaid,
he sent a white timber plate or trencher to him, when
the King was sat down to table, whereon was inscribed
these words:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="i2">When the world was drowned</div>
  <div class="i2">No deer was found,</div>
  <div class="i0">Because there was noe Park;</div>
  <div class="i2">And here I sitt</div>
  <div class="i2">Without ere a bitt,</div>
  <div class="i0">Cause Noyah hath all in his Arke.</div>
</div>

<p>Which plate being presented by the Attorney-general to
the King, produced this effect, that Jonson had a good
dish of venison sent him back by the bearer, to his great
content and satisfaction; on which aforesaid plate, by the
King’s direction, Jonson’s rhymes were thus inverted or
contradicted:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="i2">When the world was drowned</div>
  <div class="i2">There deer was found,</div>
  <div class="i0">Although there was noe park;</div>

<p>William Noye, anagram, I moyle in Law. He was the
blow-coal, incendiary, or stirrer up of the Civil Wars between
King Charles and his Parliament, by asserting and
setting up the King’s prerogative to the highest pitch, as
King James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> had done before, beyond the laws of the
land as aforesaid; and as Counsell for the King he prosecuted
for King Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> the imprisoned Members of the
House of Commons, 1628: <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Sir John Elyot, Mr. Coryton,
and others; whom after much cost and trouble he got
to be fined two thousand pounds each, the others five hundred
pounds, and further to be sentenced, notwithstanding
they paid those fines, not to be delivered from prison
without submission and acknowledgment of their offences,
<!--153.png--><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a><span class="pageno">147</span>
and security to be put in for their good behaviour for the
future.</p>

<p>Den-sill, alias Dyn-sill, in this parish, synonymous words,
signifying man-chapel or church, or a man of the church
or chapel; otherwise Den-sell is either man-great or great-man;
and upon the confines of those lands, on the high
and lofty downs, is situate Densill Barrow, that is to say
Densill grave or burying place; a notable tumulus, wherein
some person of this little barton, after the ancient British
manner, was, before or soon after Christianity prevailed,
here interred. The rubbish and down-fallen walls of a free
chapel, heretofore on this place, prove the truth of this etymology,
known now by the name of Chapel Garder; garda,
gerder, is a churchyard or field.</p>

<p>From this place was denominated an ancient family of
gentlemen, surnamed de Densill, or Densell; and the first
of those gentlemen that have come to my knowledge was
Thomas Densill, that married Skewish, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>
who had issue by her John, that married the daughter and
heir of Trenowith, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb Major, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>;
on whose right he annexed the lands of Trenowith to his
manor of Densell, as it remains to this day; (those Trenowiths
lye interred in the north side of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb Church,
now pertaining to Mr. Vivian;) by Trenowth’s heir the
said John had issue, John Densill, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> barrister at law,
who had his education at Lincoln’s Inn, afterwards was
made Serjeant at law, 1531, married Mary, daughter of
Sir &mdash;&mdash; Lucas, of Warwickshire, by whom he had issue
two daughters, that became his heirs; Anne, married to
William Hollis, of Houghton, in Nottinghamshire, knight,
ancestor of the Earls of Clare, and now Duke of Newcastle;
Alice to Mr. Reskymer, father of Sir John Reskymer, of
Reskymer, knight, Sheriff of Cornwall 27 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>
This John Densill, Serjeant at law, died 3 January 1535,
and was buried in the church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giles in the Fields.</p>

<p>The name, estate, and blood of those Densills, being
thus terminated in Hollis and Reskymer, the Hollis’s have
<!--154.png--><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a><span class="pageno">148</span>
long time made it a font name in their family, to preserve
the memory thereof; in particular, there was lately extant
Densill Hollis, created Baron Hollis, of Ifield, 2 April
1661, Privy Councillor to King Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> Lord High
Steward of the honours, manors, and revenues to his Queen
Catharine; Extraordinary Ambassador in France 1663,
1664, 1665, 1666; afterwards Ambassador and Plenipotentiary
at Breda, 1667; uncle unto John and Gilbert late
Earls of Clare.</p>

<p>This little barton and manor of Densill was by the Earl
of Clare sold to Buller, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>; from Buller to
Vivian, of Truan; and by Vivian to Pendarves, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr>
William <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> 1700; and from Pendarves to Upton, now
in possession thereof, as I am informed.</p>

<p>From the family of Densill, by a younger branch, was
descended the Densills of Philley, in Devon; in particular
Richard Densill, younger brother to the Serjeant’s father,
whose only daughter and heir was married to Martin Fortescue,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who first brought Buckland Filleigh to that
family, as I am informed; after his decease she was married
to Sir Richard Pomeroye, of Bury Pomeroye, in
Devon, Knight of the Bath at the creation of Henry Prince
of Wales, afterwards Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr></p>

<p>Quere whether John de Mawgan Sheriff of Cornwall
12 and 19th of Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> were not of this parish or
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mawgan in Kerryer; as also the Mawgans of Essex,
who gave for their arms, Argent, two bars, in chief three
mullets Sable.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>The patron of this parish is <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mawgan, one of the
missionaries from Ireland.</p>

<p>It is a rectory, in the patronage of Sir John Arundell,
of the Lanhearne, which was the ancient name of the
parish; which, says the author of the English Etymological
<!--155.png--><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><span class="pageno">149</span>
Dictionary, is not unlikely from Lan, a church, and Herwa,
to fly, meaning a place of refuge.</p>

<p>I shall begin with the most important place,</p>

<p class="p2 center smaller">THE MANOR OF LANHEARNE.</p>

<p>This place had formerly possessors of the same name,
but how long they lived in it is uncertain; for I can meet
with but one and the last of them; John de Lanhearne,
who by Margaret, the daughter and heir of Richard Fitz
John, had only one daughter and heir, Alice, married the
15th Henry <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> (<abbr title="Anno Domini">A. D.</abbr> 1231) to Sir R. Arundell, of
Trembleth, Knight, ever since which time Lanhearne hath
been the principal seat of this illustrious family. I shall
not here enter into a detail of the many great men it hath
produced, referring myself to their well known pedigrees;
and shall only take notice here that the Lord Arundell of
Wardour, Arundell of Tolvorne, Trevethick, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> were descended
from younger branches thereof; and insert what
Mr. Camden and Mr. Carew say of them. The first hath
these words:</p>

<p>“Near which place (<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb), at a little distance
from the sea, stands Lanhearon, the seat of the family of
the Arundells, knights, who upon account of their vast
riches, were not long since called ‘The Great Arundells.’
They are sometimes called in Latin De Hirundine; and
appositely enough in my mind, for a swallow in French is
Hirondelle, and their arms are, in a field Sable, six swallows
Argent. ’Tis certainly an ancient and noble family,
as also very numerous: to the arms whereof Brito, a poet,
alludes, where he describes a warlike man of this family
attacking a Frenchman, about the year 1170.</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">Swift as the swallows whence his arms device</div>
  <div class="i0">And his own name are took, enraged he flies</div>
  <div class="i0">Through gazing troops, the wonder of the field,</div>
  <div class="i0">And sticks his lance in William’s glittering shield.”</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Carew says of this family:</p>

<p>“Their name is derived from Hirundelle, in French a
<!--156.png--><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a><span class="pageno">150</span>
swallow, and out of France at the Conquest they came,
and six swallows they give in arms. The country people
entitle them ‘The Great Arundells,’ and greatest for love,
living, and respect, in the country heretofore they were.”
(See Carew, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 343, Lord De Dunstanville’s edition.)</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The name of Arundell has not, in all probability, any
thing to do with swallows. It is on the contrary derived
from their Castle in the Arun Dale, Sussex, which like all
other British or Saxon names having the slightest resemblance
in sound to a French word, has been referred to a
Norman origin.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons says that Sir John Arundell, the last of the
Lanhearne branch, or parent stock, who died in 1701,
settled his estates on his grandson, Richard Billinge, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
with the condition of his taking the name of Arundell.
This gentleman had an only daughter and heiress, who
carried the property by her marriage to the Lords Arundell
of Wardour.</p>

<p>It does not appear that any of the Wardour Arundells
have ever resided at Lanhearne; with a sectarian attachment
to the ancient faith, they kept up a Catholic establishment
at this place, and retained great numbers of the
parishioners in communion with the See of Rome, by making
it a passport to lucrative employment and to good cheer;
but the house having been appropriated to the reception
of Nuns from Antwerp, of the order of Carmelites, as reformed
by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Tereza, and the secular establishment broken
up, the system of private interpretation has entirely superseded
the authority of Popes and Councils, so that not
a Catholic can now be found without the walls. The Nuns
were received here on their flying from the French Invasion
to their native country, for all were English, and their
numbers are still maintained by fresh recruits.</p>

<p>Henry Arundell, the 8th Baron Arundell, of Wardour,
<!--157.png--><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a><span class="pageno">151</span>
having built a magnificent house adjacent to the old
castle, and feeling little interest about the property in
Cornwall, although it is said to have regularly descended
through the Dinhams, from a period anterior to the Norman
Conquest, sold the whole in parcels, with the exception
of Lanhearne, and has thereby several the very ancient
connexion of his family with this county.</p>

<p>The church stands near the river, and adjacent to the
house of Lanhearne. It is decorated on the inside with a
rood loft, very few of which have been suffered to remain,
and by monuments to the Arundells, with inscriptions,
most of which may be found in Mr. C. S. Gilbert’s History
of Cornwall.</p>

<p>There is also another to Humphrey Noye, which, as his
descendant and heir, the Editor hopes he may be excused
for transcribing:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">Here lyeth the Body of</div>

  <div class="i2">the 12<sup>th</sup> of December,</div>
  <div class="i2"><abbr title="Anno Domini">Annoq<sup>e</sup> Dom</abbr>: 1679.</div>
</div>

<p>On the stone are the arms:</p>

<p><abbr title="Argent">Arg.</abbr> three bends and a canton <abbr title="Sable">Sab.</abbr> on the canton an
English cross of the Field.</p>

<p>The crest of Noye is a dove bearing an olive branch,
and the motto: Teg yw Hedwch, Lovely in Peace. Evidently
an allusion to the names Noye and Noah.</p>

<p>The above words were on a slate stone laid flat on
the pavement, so that the letters were beginning to disappear;
but Mr. Humphry Willyams, his successor in Carnarton,
although not his descendant, has recently preserved
<!--158.png--><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a><span class="pageno">152</span>
the stone and the inscription, by placing this memorial
perpendicularly against one of the walls.</p>

<p>The manor of Carnarton belonged to the father, if not
to the grandfather, of the Attorney-general. He was born
however at Pendrea, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Burian, where the family had
been settled time out of mind, but understood to be of
Norman extraction.</p>

<p>Little is known of Mr. Noye’s early life, till he became
a member of Exeter College, in the year 1593. He removed
from thence to Lincoln’s Inn, and was chosen
Member for Helston to the Parliament which met in
January 1620. He afterwards represented <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, and
certainly took an active, zealous, and able part in fostering
the nascent liberties of his country; but having formed a
connexion with Mr. Wentworth, he became a partizan in
what was afterwards named the Stafford Faction, was made
Attorney-general in 1631, devised the exaction of Ship
Money, and conducted himself in a manner very different
from the promise of his former days; fortunately for himself,
Mr. Noye died in 1634, before the more violent agitations
commenced, which terminated in the Civil War. He

and Catharine.</p>

<p>Edward lost his life not long after the Attorney-general’s
decease, in a duel with a Captain Byron. Humphrey
then inherited the property.</p>

<p>Catharine married John Cartwright, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> of Aynhoe, in
Northamptonshire, whose descendant in the fifth degree,
William Ralph Cartwright, is now of that place (1835),
and Member for the county.</p>

<p>Mr. Noye had the honour of receiving the public thanks
of his College, under the following circumstances: Sir
William Petre, son of John Petre, of Torbryan in Devonshire,
well known as Secretary of State in the time of King
Henry the Eighth, and successively in the reigns of his
three successors, had been a Commoner of Exeter College,
and from thence elected a Fellow of All Souls. He afterwards
became Principal of Peckwater Hall, one of the
Visitors of Religious Houses, and finally Secretary of State.
Sir John Petre, by participating in the good fortune of all
those who were favourites at Court in this eventful period
of our history, appropriated to himself a share of the Confiscated
Church Lands, most profusely distributed; and by
so doing became the founder of a family still existing,
with an hereditary seat in Parliament, and professing the
Catholic religion. Wishing perhaps to make some restitution,
Sir John Petre founded eight Fellowships at Exeter
College, in the Protestant University of Oxford, to all of
which, called Petrean Fellowships, he continued to nominate
during his life, according to an ancient custom in
similar cases; but when his successors attempted to exercise
the same right or privilege, they were resisted by the
College, and the cause came to be tried in the Court of
Common Pleas, under the form of a replevin; they were
successfully and gratuitously supported by Mr. Noye, as
will appear from the passage in the College Register.</p>

<p>The Editor possesses a picture of Mr. Noye painted on
oak, by Cornelius Jansen; and at the desire of Exeter
College, he has recently presented to them a copy, which
is placed in the Hall.</p>

<p>Mr. Noye was succeeded by his eldest son Edward;
but the melancholy forebodings expressed in his will: “I
have left all the remainder of my property to my son Edward
(whom I have constituted executor of this my will) to
be squandered, nor have I ever hoped any better,” were
rendered vain by the death of this young man, soon after
that of his father, in a duel with a Captain Byron.</p>

<p>Humphrey then succeeded as eldest son, and in the
year 1637 allied himself by marriage with the very distinguished
family of Sandys, of The Vine, near Basingstoke,
in Hampshire.</p>

<p>The Editor has their marriage contract, which may be
esteemed a curiosity, as compared with the more lengthened
writings of recent times.</p>

<p>The seals appended under the signatures Henry Sandys
and Hester Sandys, bear the impressions: Argent, a cross
raguly Sable; arms of their maternal ancestors, Sandys,
of The Vine.</p>

<p>This lady’s grandfather, Sir Edwin Sandys, nephew of
Edwin Sandys, Archbishop of York, whose family originated
from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bees, in Cumberland, bearing for their
arms, Or, a fess dancette between three crosses crosslet
fitchy Gules; married Elizabeth, daughter and sole heiress
of William Baron Sandys, of The Vine, by tenure in fee,
under a writ of summons issued by King Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> on
the <abbr title="third">3d</abbr> of November 1529, in the 21st year of his reign.
Their son Henry Sandys, party to the above marriage
settlement, married his first cousin Margaret, daughter of
Sir William Sandys, of Hedbury, in the County of Worcester,
and lost his life in one of the battles of the Civil
<!--165.png--><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a><span class="pageno">159</span>
War, in 1644. They had several children, of whom William,
Henry, and Edwin, were in succession summoned to
Parliament on the right deduced from their grandmother,
and with the last of these the barony fell again into abeyance.
Hester, their eldest sister, married Colonel Humphrey
Noye, and their daughter, Catharine, on the 21st
of July 1679, married William Davies, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Erth. John
Davies, their son and ultimate heir, married Elizabeth
Phillips, of Tredrea; and their daughter and heiress married
the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Edward Giddy, whose only son is the Editor
of this work.</p>

<p>Another daughter of Colonel Humphrey Noye and
Hester Sandys, christened Bridgman, in remembrance of
Sir Orlando Bridgman, an early friend and patron of the
Attorney-general, married Mr. John Willyams of Roseworthy,
in Gwiniar, and, dying without issue, left him Carnanton,
which had fallen to her share. Mr. Willyams
married secondly Dorothy, daughter of Mr. John Day, by
whom he had two sons.</p>

<p>John, the elder, married the daughter and heiress of
Mr. Oliver, a gentleman of Falmouth. They had a son,
Mr. John Oliver Willyams, for many years Colonel of the
Cornwall Militia; and a daughter Ann, married to Mr.
William Lemon, jun. only son of the great Mr. Lemon.
The younger son was James; whose son James Willyams
succeeded to Carnanton, under the will of his first cousin
John Oliver Willyams, in the year 1809; and his son,
Humphrey Willyams, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> now resides there, having so
much altered and improved the house and gardens, as to
place Carnanton among the gentlemen’s residences of the
first class in Cornwall.</p>

<p>Thomas Willyams, a Captain in the Navy (brother of
Mr. John Willyams, who married Miss Bridgman Noye,)
married &mdash;&mdash; Fox, of Deal; they left a son John Willyams,
also a Captain in the Navy, who married Anne
Goodyere, and their son, the Reverend Cooper Willyams,

<p>He married Elizabeth Snell, of Whitby.</p>

<p>Mr. Cooper Willyams died July the 17th, 1816, leaving
two sons and two daughters.</p>

<p>The late Mr. John Oliver Willyams related to me an
anecdote, illustrative of the contingencies which are incident
to human life, and of the concatenation between public
and private events.</p>

<p>His grandfather, Mr. John Willyams, had undertaken a
journey to Oxford in the year 1685, but was stopped at
Exeter by the Duke of Monmouth’s invasion; he returned
in company with a gentleman of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Columb, and
remained there a few days, where at some public exhibition
he met with Miss Bridgman Noye, who soon afterwards
became his wife.</p>

<p>Mr. Hals devotes some pages to the virulent abuse of
Colonel Humphrey Noye, against whom it is obvious that
he must have entertained a personal animosity; but the
Editor, having omitted various similar effusions, hopes that
he shall not be accused of any partial favour towards his
own ancestors, by omitting this also, which does not carry
with it the semblance of truth.</p>

<abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 1628, who asserted the prerogative of
Parliament, the liberty and property of the subject, against
the despotic and arbitrary power of the Monarch, set up

five hundred pounds, and could not be delivered from

prison till he had paid that sum, but forced to make a
submission and acknowledgment of his offence, and put in
security for his good behaviour.</p>

<p>He was the father of Sir John Coryton, of this place,
who, the 27th February 13 Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> 1661, was by his
letters patent of that date, created the 605th Baronet of
England. He married Mills of Exeter, and had issue by
her Sir John Coryton, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> his eldest son; who married
one of the heirs of Mr. Richard Chiverton, Knight, bred
a Skinner in London, and was Lord Mayor of that city

He was Sheriff of Cornwall, 1682.</p>

<p>After his decease his younger brother, William Coryton,

heretofore interred, before and after the Roman Invasion.
(See Tacitus in the life of Agricola.) This place was the
<!--169.png--><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a><span class="pageno">163</span>
dwelling of Charles Trevisa, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> that married with
Fortescue; who giveth for his arms, Gules, a garb Or.
Denominated, I suppose from Trevisa, or Tre-wisa, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Enedor, and originally descended from John Trevisa, born
in Gloucestershire (as Baker saith), who being for some
time bred in Oxford, afterwards took orders, and became
a secular priest, that might marry; and then became domestic
chaplain to Thomas Lord Berkeley, by whom he
was afterwards made Vicar of Berkeley in Gloucestershire;
where, at that Lord’s request, he translated the Sacred
Bible into the English tongue, though the same was done
by John Wickliff fifty years before, but not with that perfection
of language that Trevisa did it; although Trevisa’s
translation is altogether as far short of Tyndall’s in Henry
the Eighth’s days, by reason the English tongue was still
improving to a higher perfection; and yet Tyndall’s translation
was far inferior to that of King James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> notwithstanding
they all agree in the original substance, sense,
and meaning of words in those translations; wherein Wickliff,
Trevisa, and Tyndall, made use of infinite Cornish-British
words to express the same. Neither is the last
translation of King James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> altogether void of them.</p>

<p>Mr. Trevisa also translated Bartholomew de Proprietatibus
Rerum; the Poly-chronicon of Ralph Higden; a
treatise of all the Acts of King Arthur; and divers other
things. Lastly, this learned and painful priest died about
the year 1470, aged about eighty-six years.</p>

<p>Westcot, in this parish, was another district taxed in the
Domesday Book, 1087; it is now the dwelling, as I take
it, of Mr. William Brendon, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr></p>

<p>In this parish is Pentyley, or Pillaton, a house and
church built and so named by Mr. James Tillie, afterwards
knighted, and married the widow of Sir John Coryton.</p>

<p>Since the writing of the above premises, about the year
1712, Sir James Tillie died, and as I am informed, by his
last will and testament, obliged his adopted heir, one
Woolley his sister’s son, not only to assume his name,
<!--170.png--><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a><span class="pageno">164</span>
(having no legitimate issue) but that he should not inter
his body after death in the earth, but fasten it in the chair
where he died with iron, his hat, wig, rings, gloves, and
best apparel on, shoes and stockings, and surround the
same with an oak chest, box, or coffin, in which his books
and papers should be laid, with pen and ink also; and
build for reception thereof, in a certain field of his lands,
a walled vault or grot, to be arched with moorstone; in
which repository it should be laid without Christian burial;
for that as he said but an hour before he died, in two years
space he would be at Pentillie again; over this vault his
heir likewise was obliged to build a fine chamber, and set
up therein the picture of him, his lady, and adopted heir
for ever; and at the end of this vault and chamber to erect
a spire or lofty monument of stone, from thence for spectators
to overlook the contiguous country, Plymouth Sound
and Harbour; all which as I am told is accordingly performed
by his heir, whose successors are obliged to repair
the same for ever out of his lands and rents, under penalty
of losing both.</p>

<p>However I hear lately, notwithstanding this his promise
of returning in two years space to Pentiley, that Sir James’s
body is eaten out with worms, and his bones or skeleton
fallen down to the ground from the chair wherein it was
seated, about four years after it was set up; his wig, books,
wearing apparel, also rotten in the box or chair where it
was first laid.</p>

<p>I take this parish, as well as Mullion in Kerrier, to take
its name from its tutelar saint, Melania. The church is a
rectory; the patronage in Sir John Coryton.</p>

<p>The principal manor and seat in this parish is West
Newton Ferrers, so called from its relative situation to
another Newton, and from its ancient lords the Ferrers.
As for the name Newton, it signifies no other than the plain
meaning of the word, a new town or house. In the valuation
<!--171.png--><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a><span class="pageno">165</span>
made by Edward the First this manor is called Newton,
without any addition, as is the case at present in
common speech.</p>

<p>William de Ferrers was Knight of this shire with
Thomas Sereod, Knight, 8 Edward <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Mr. Hals has given a long history of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Melania, the
supposed patron of this church, containing, however, little
more than the usual details of effects produced by the
ascetic fanaticism popular in those days. Personal sufferings
and privations were then endured, under a persuasion
that bodily pain, mental stupidity, and a course of life utterly
useless to the human race, could alone ensure the
divine favour, in opposition to the sentiments,</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
  <div class="i0">Hic manus ob patriam pugnando vulnera passi;</div>
  <div class="i0">Quique sacerdotes casti, dum vita manebat;</div>

  <div class="i0">Inventas aut qui vitam excoluere per artes;</div>
  <div class="i0">Quique sui memores alios fecere merendo.</div>
</div>

<p>Newton came into the family of Coryton, by a marriage
with the heiress of Ferrers, and continued till that family
became extinct in the male line, on the decease of Sir John
Coryton in 1739, who gave the property to his widow Rachael,
a daughter of Weston Helyar, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of East Coker
in Somersetshire; and it has continued with her relations
nearly to the present time, under an entail, which carried
Newton from Mr. Weston Helyar, probably a great-grandson
of the gentleman above mentioned, to several other
younger brothers; till the failure of heirs male in all these
brought it back to the son or grandson of the elder brother,
who, wishing to concentrate his property in Somersetshire,
has parted with the whole Cornish estate to Edward Collins,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Truthan.</p>

<p>Although Sir John Coryton alienated his principal seat
<!--172.png--><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a><span class="pageno">166</span>
and manor by this bequest to his widow, he devised a large
share of the family property to the descendants of his eldest
sister Elizabeth, who married William Goodall, of Fowey;
and their grandson, on succeeding to the estate, assumed
the name of Coryton. The present representative of this
ancient family, John Tillie Coryton, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> has built a magnificent
house or castle at Pentilly in a most beautiful
situation, on the Tamar river, so that he need not regret
the loss of Newton.</p>

<p>Sir John Coryton had two other sisters, one of whom,
Johanna, married John Peter, of Harlyn, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> The third
sister married a gentleman of the name of Vaughan.</p>

<p>In addition to the tales relative to Sir James Tillie’s funeral
direction, Mr. Hals has added several others, all to
this gentleman’s disadvantage, but not in any way illustrative
of the times in which he lived, or of the general manners
prevalent in the country: they are therefore omitted,
with the exception of one respecting armorial bearings.</p>

<p>It is certain that Mr. Tillie was one of those persons,
most justly esteemed, who advance themselves in the world
without being beholden in any considerable degree to their
ancestors. Mr. Tillie was knighted by King James <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>
and then not finding himself provided with a coat of arms,
he assumed, as Mr. Hals states, the blazon of Count Tillie,
a German Prince, which coming to the knowledge of King
James, an inquisition was ordered, the fact was established,
and a fine imposed on the knight, in addition to the demolition
of the assumed arms, with some acts of indignity.</p>

<p>It is moreover proper to add, that although Sir James
Tillie did without all question express some absurd fancies
in respect to his mortal remains, which were in part executed,
yet they are far from bearing the colour of impiety
cast on them by Mr. Hals, and still less are they chargeable
with the blasphemies imputed to them by Mr. Gilpin.</p>

<p>The church and tower are plain on the outside, but
within are several handsome monuments to the Corytons.</p>

<p>It seems much more probable that this church is dedicated
<!--173.png--><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><span class="pageno">167</span>
to Mellitus, the first Bishop of London, and third
Archbishop of Canterbury, than to an obscure African
lady.</p>

<p>Bede has given various particulars of this eminent person,
and his life may be found in Capgrave’s Aurea Legenda.
He led a second body of missionaries in aid of the
great <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austin, and the conversion of a Pagan temple
into a Christian church, since expanded into <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul’s Cathedral,
and also the foundation of Westminster Abbey,
are imputed to him. He departed this life on the 24th of
April, in the year 624.</p>

Saxon signifies a gate (as porth in British). This manor
is one of the franchises of Cornwall, privileged with the jurisdiction

<p>This manor of Men-hyn-yet, as I remember, was formerly
the lands of one Carmenow, a soldier or military
man; by whose daughter and heir it came first in marriage
to Trelawny, in Edward the Fourth’s days. Within the
precincts of which lordship is situate the house and barton
of Poole, so called after the English from the natural circumstances
of the place; where, by reason of the level or
evenness of the town place, in winter season many lakes
and pools of water stand. Of which place thus speaks Mr.
Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall: “Poole, for its lowe
and moyst seate, is not unaptly named, houseth Sir Jonathan
Trelawny, far beneath his worth and callinge. He

coheir of Reskimer, his grandfather Lamellyn’s inheritrix.
His arms are Argent, a chevron Sable, between three oak
leaves Vert.”</p>

<p>There is a public fair held yearly in this church town, on
June 11.</p>

<p>Ten-creek, Den-creek, in this parish, was formerly the
lands and possessions of Richard Earl of Cornwall, King
of the Romans, second son of King John; who probably at
some time lived at it (as also at his castle of Leskeard), for
in the old dilapidated houses of this once famous fabric, I
saw the ruins of a moorstone oven, about fourteen foot diameter,
in testimony of the hospitality once kept here.
And moreover, in the front of the castlewise moorstone
gate, or portal, I beheld his arms cut in stone; <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> within
a bordure bezantée, a lion rampant crowned, whose arms
in colours I think ought to be thus blazoned: ill port ung

<p>Tre-havock, in this parish, Cornish Saxon, id est, the
hawk town, was taxed in the Domesday Book, 1087, as
the voke lands of a parish or manor which now is suitably
called after the Cornish English Tre-hauke; for that it
seems heretofore it was a place notable for keeping,
mewing, or breeding hawks (or for that those lands
were held by the tenure of paying hawks to its lord);
from which place was denominated an old family of gentlemen
surnamed de Tre-hauke, who gave for their arms,
in a field Sable, a chevron between three hawks. It is
now in the possession of Peter Keckwich, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> descended
from the Keckwiches of Catch-French, as they were from
the Keckwiches of Essex; who give for their arms, Argent,

minister in Cornwall that said or taught the Lord’s Prayer,
the Ten Commandments, and the Creed in the English
tongue. (See Feock and Creed.) He also catechised the
children therein; which I judge was in the latter end of
King Henry the Eighth’s, or the beginning of King Edward
the Sixth’s reign, 1549; for then by proclamation
were called in all books of the Latin service for churches;
and the Bishops commanded in their several dioceses that
forthwith should be warned, all prebendaries of their cathedral
churches, all parsons, vicars, curates, and the churchwardens
of every parish within their dioceses, to bring in
and deliver up particularly.</p>

<p>The church of this large and opulent parish is of size
proportioned to it, having three large aisles. The tower
is low and surmounted by a spire. In the church are some
monuments, but not of much antiquity.</p>

<p>Archbishop Courtenay appears to have settled the right
of presentation to this parish, by giving it to the Chapter
of Exeter, with the limitation of their always bestowing it
on some one who is at the time, or has been, a Fellow of
Exeter College. The vicarage is endowed with the great
tithes, on a payment of £20 a year to Exeter College,
and it is therefore considered as a rectory. Mr. Carew
observes (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 277, Lord de Dunstanville’s edition) that this
parish has been successively graced with three well born
and well educated incumbents, Doctor Tremayne, Master
Billett, and Master Dennis; and it is believed that William
of Wykeham held this preferment for some time previously
to Archbishop Courtenay’s endowment.</p>

<p>The late incumbent, the Reverend William Holwell,
may be noticed for his taste and skill in the fine arts.
He was the son of a medical practitioner at Exeter, and
nephew of William Holwell, student and tutor of Christ
Church soon after the middle of the last century, and then
Vicar of Thornbury, in Gloucestershire, where he died in
1798, having distinguished himself by the following, among
other works:</p>

<p>The Beauties of Homer, selected from the Iliad, <abbr title="octavo">8vo.</abbr></p>

<p>Extracts from Pope’s Translations of Homer compared
with the Beauties of the Original. <abbr title="octavo">8vo.</abbr></p>

<p>A Mythological, Etymological, and Historical Dictionary.
<abbr title="octavo">8vo.</abbr></p>

<p>Mr. William Holwell, the nephew, was of course a Fellow
of Exeter College. He travelled through France and
Italy about the year 1780, where he began forming a collection
of pictures, bequeathed on his decease to the National
<!--178.png--><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a><span class="pageno">172</span>
Gallery. He is said to have taken Orders with some
reluctance, for the purpose of accepting this valuable living.
But the most important event in this gentleman’s life was
his marrying Charlotte, daughter and heiress of James
Carr, Earl of Erroll. He in consequence assumed the
name of Carr. He died in the year 1830, having survived
his wife nearly twenty years, who has a monument to her
memory in Menheniot church.</p>

<p>In the valuation of Pope Nicholas, the name of this
parish is written Manyhinyhet, or Saihinet, proofs of the
small reliance that can be placed on mere phonic etymologies.</p>

<p>Cartuther, noticed by Mr. Hals, became the property
and the residence of the Morsheads, but having been sold,
with all the other possessions of that family, it was purchased
by Mr. Kekewich.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons gives a detail of other manors and bartons
of little interest.</p>

<p>This parish has the reputation of being the most fertile
of corn, especially of wheat, in the whole county. The
aspect of the church town gives a strong impression of
monastic remains, but there is not any tradition on record
of a religious establishment in the place.</p>

<p>Menheniot measures 6047 statute acres.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DOCTOR BOASE.</p>

<p>The southern part of this parish is bounded by the hill
of Clicker Tor, which is entirely composed of a dark compact
serpentine, abounding in steatite, asbestos, tremolite,
and other magnesian minerals. The occurrence of this
<!--179.png--><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a><span class="pageno">173</span>
large mass of serpentine, amidst an extensive tract of rocks
belonging to the calcareous series, imparts no little geological
interest to this parish, which deserves therefore to be
more minutely examined; for the cursory observations
hitherto published have not satisfactorily developed the
connection of this serpentine with the adjoining rocks.
In crossing the parish from north to south, the rocks are
first seen to consist of compact felspar and hornblend, resembling
those at Rosecradock in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clear; next they
become more schistose, and the hornblend forms only the
colouring material, as it does on the north of Leskeard
town; at Pengover the hornblend again abounds, and is
intermixed with calcareous spar, as in the vicinity of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
<a name="err_10" id="err_10"></a>Ives. Approaching the church of Menheniot, the rocks
again put on the appearance of a true hornblend schist,
and this is succeeded by the serpentine of Clicker Tor.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Not only is the serpentine of the Lizard found at Clicker
Tor, but the plant also indicative of that formation, the
great ornament of our southern promontory, the <span class="sc">Errica
Vagans</span>, the multiflora of Hudson and Ray, and the didyma
of Withering. Nothing seems to be more extraordinary,
nor what, independently of experience, would be
more unexpected, than the existence of the same rare plants
at distant and unconnected places, where the peculiarities
of soil and climate happen to agree; but to increase the
wonder still further, even this diffusion has its limits. The
southern hemisphere is said not to be decorated by a single
wild rose, the Ανασσα Ανθων Anassa Anthôn of the northern world. And
the whole continent of America is believed not to produce
a single heath.</p>

<p>Our preconceptions of what would be fitting for intelligences
superior to our own, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a fortiori</i> as to what might
be expected from infinite wisdom and power, have been
<!--180.png--><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a><span class="pageno">174</span>
established beyond the shadow of a doubt by <span class="sc">Sir Isaac
Newton</span>, in respect to the great bodies moving in our universe.
They perform all their revolutions in obedience to
the simple and general laws of gravity and inertia; and
the rapidly progressive discoveries of each succeeding year,
establish the same principle respecting causes acting conformably
to general laws in the internal construction, preservation,
and renovation of our planet; and we are moreover
induced to believe that a like system must prevail in
the moral world, not from analogy alone, but from a
deep conviction that such a plan, and no other, can reconcile
the existence of partial evil with universal good:
and thus conciliate the actual state of things with the attributes
of unlimited goodness, wisdom, and power; but
in respect to animal and vegetable life, although an arrangement
as plain and as demonstrative of infinite wisdom may
exist, it is, in the actual state of our knowledge, utterly
hidden from our view. Thousands of distinct species or
genera have ceased to exist, and their remains, varying
from the most gigantic skeletons to objects suited for a
microscope, are daily brought under our view&mdash;animals
and plants have succeeded each other in the various geological
periods, tending in succession towards more elaborate
construction and greater general perfection; but not
a trace is laid before us of the plan by which this beautiful
system is arranged; our ignorance compels us therefore
to suppose the immediate agency of <span class="sc">the Divinity</span> itself,
when a plant indigenous to an old formation appears on
one more recently elevated to the surface; or when any

<p class="p2 center small">HALS.</p>

<p>Mer-in or Mer-yn, is situated in the hundred of Pedyr,
and hath upon the north the Irish sea, west <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Evall, south
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ervyn, north-east Padstow.</p>

<p>In the Domesday Book this district was taxed by the
name of Trevoes or Trevose, id est, the maid or virgin’s
town; then and now the voke lands of a manor annexed
to Pawton, or Polton, (parcel of the lands of the Prior of
Bodman and Bishop of Exon before the Norman Conquest,)
on the confines of which, towards the sea, is yet extant the
ruins of an old church, chapel, and cemetery pertaining
thereto, dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Constantine, the first Christian
Emperor of Rome: which, upon the encroachment of the
sea-sand on the marsh beneath, which surrounded and overwhelmed
the same, was discontinued, and thereby gave
occasion to the inhabitants to build their now church of
Merin in a more secure place, further up in the country
from the sea and sand, and moor or marsh ground; the
church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Constantine being in part converted now to
a dwelling house for poor people.</p>

<p>Near this church is yet extant <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Constantine’s Well,
strong built of stone and arched over; on the inner part
hereof are places or seats for people to sit and wash themselves
in the streams thereof; the consequence of which
facts, if the inhabitants may be credited, is not only very
refreshing and salubrious, but, if it be dry weather, immediately
showers of rain will follow.</p>

<p>The barton of Trevose is now, by lease, in possession of
Gregory Peter, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> and Lawrence Growden, that well-known
Quaker, the reversionary fee pertaining to Sir Nicholas
Morice, Baronet, as parcel of his manor of Pawton;
and is a large lofty promontory of land, shooting out far
<!--182.png--><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a><span class="pageno">176</span>
into the Irish sea, beyond all other lands there, yet notable
for its production of sheep, barley, and rabbits, and not
altogether unprofitable for bullocks in winter season; and
as fatal and unfortunate for wrecking ships, that happen
by night or stormy weather to fall on the rocks thereof, at
that or any other time.</p>

<p>Arel-yn, alias Har-lyn, in this parish. This barton is
the dwelling of my very kind friend and brother-in-law,
Gregory Peter, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Sheriff of Cornwall part of the last
year of William <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> and first of Queen Anne, 1701;
he married Elizabeth, daughter of Gove of Devon, the
relict of William Wadland, merchant, by whom he
had issue two sons, William and John; William died
without issue, and John that married Anne, the daughter
of Sir John Coryton, of Newton, Baronet, by whom he
hath a numerous issue of children of both sexes. After
the death of the said Elizabeth, he married the daughter
of Anthony Carveth, of Peransand, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> his cousin-german
removed, and hath issue by her Francis Peter.</p>

<p>Gregory Peter aforesaid was the son of Thomas Peter,
of Treater, in Padstow, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> who married the daughter
and heir of Mitchell, lord of Harlyn; the which Thomas
Peter was the son of John Peter, of Trenaran, in Padstow,
<abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> that married Toms, as John Peter was the son of
John Peter of Trenaran, that married Kestell.</p>

<p>Whether this surname of Peter be derived from the
Christian or font name of some of their ancestors, or from
their being ancient inhabitants of Pedyrstowe, id est, Peter’s
dwelling, now Padstow, I cannot resolve. Their arms are
in a field Gules, on a bend between two escallops Argent,
two Cornish dawes Proper; much resembling the arms of
the Lord Petre of Exeter, now of Essex.</p>

<p>If this church of Merin, or Meran, were extant, it was
not endowed with any revenues at the time of the Inquisition
of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester, into the
value of Cornish Benefices, 1294, since it is not named
therein. And the five churches of Peran-sand, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes,
<!--183.png--><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a><span class="pageno">177</span>
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb Minor, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Breock, Lanhidrock, were then
under the same circumstances.</p>

<p>The tutelar guardian of this new church of Merin is <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, whose festival
is duly celebrated by the inhabitants of this parish of Meran
on July the 7th, being commonly called his day, a
hundred and twenty-two years after his death made a calendered
Saint, who was slain at the altar in his cathedral
church of Canterbury, the 30th of December 1172.</p>

<p>In Wolsey’s Inquisition, 1521, this vicarage of Merin
was valued for its revenues £15. 16<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 8<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> The patronage
in the Bishop of Exeter, or the Dean and Chapter, who endowed
it; the incumbent Gurney; the rectory or sheaf in
possession of Francis Peter aforesaid; and the parish rated
to the 4s. per pound Land Tax for one year, 1696, £241.</p>

<p>One Margaret Tregoweth, of Crantock, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>
gave lands in Harlyn, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> a dwelling-house and garden,
with commons there, towards the repair of blessed <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Meran
and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas Becket’s church, of about £12 per
annum for ever. [But who this Sanctus Meranus, or <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Meran, was I know not.]</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>Mr. Tonkin does not add any thing to the history of
this parish except the following assertion.</p>

<p>This parish takes its name from a female patroness,
Sancta Merina, so that the name should be written Merin.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Mr. Tonkin has not given any information respecting
St Merina, nor is any such name to be found.</p>

<p>The barton of Harlyn, or Arlyn, belonged to the family
of Tregewe; from that family it passed by a marriage to
the family of Michell, and with the heiress of Michell to
Peter. Perthcothen, which belonged to the family of Trevethen,
is now the seat of another Mr. Peter.</p>

<p><!--184.png--><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a><span class="pageno">178</span>
The manor of Trevose having formed a part of the very
extensive property acquired by the Roberts’s, was purchased
from them by the Morices of Werington, and in
the division of property between the coheiresses of that
family, it fell to the share of Molesworth of Pencanow;
one part of it is held on lease by Mr. Peter, of Harlyn,
and another belonged to the late Mr. Rawlings, of Padstow.</p>

<p>There is not any thing remarkable about the church.
The stone in that immediate neighbourhood, at a place
called Catacluse, is very favourable for building, and for
ornamental work, as may be seen in the fonts at this
church and at Padstow, and also in the ruins of the old
church, dedicated to Constantine.</p>

<p>The Editor has been favoured with the following communication
respecting this ancient building, by William
Peter, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Harlyn.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Constantine church is now in ruins, and the parish (if it
ever was one) has been long merged in that of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Merryn.
The festival of Constantine is still celebrated by an annual
hurling match, on which occasion the owner of Harlyn supplies,
and has (according to parish tradition) from time
immemorial supplied, the silver ball.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Adjoining the church of Constantine was a cottage which
a family of the name of Edwards held for generations,
under the proprietors of Harlyn, by the annual render of a
pie, made of limpets, raisins, and various herbs, on the
eve of the festival. This pie, as I have heard from my
father and from more ancient members of the family, and
from old servants, was excellent. The Edwards’s had pursued
for centuries the occupation of shepherds on Harlyn
and Constantine commons. The last died about forty
years ago, and the wreck of their cottage is almost buried
in sand.”</p>

<p>The font and the pillars of Constantine church are handsomely
carved out of Catacluse stone, and Mr. Peter adds,
that the font was transferred by his great-grandfather to
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Merryn Church, when it underwent a thorough repair.</p>

<p><!--185.png--><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a><span class="pageno">179</span>
Under Catacluse Cliffs is a small pier, constructed by
the late Mr. Peter for the shelter of coasting vessels and
boats.</p>

<p>The feast of Constantine is kept on the nearest Sunday
to the 10th of March.</p>

<p>The feast in honour of the comparatively modern Saint
to whom <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Merryn Church is dedicated, is celebrated on
the nearest Sunday to July the 7th, the Translation of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas of Canterbury (Becket).</p>

<p>The great tithes belong to the Chapter of Exeter, and
the Bishop collates to the vicarage. It has been remarked
that three successive gentlemen of the name of Gurney
held the living for above a century.</p>

<p>The diversion of hurling, mentioned by Mr. Peter as
taking place on the festival in honour of Constantine, is
now wholly discontinued, or kept up on this particular occasion
as a mere remembrance of former times, when the
manners of society were more adapted to such rude exertions
of activity and strength. For an account of hurling
see Carew, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 195, Lord Dunstanville’s edition.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Bayley, the present Vicar of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Merryn,
was collated in 1803 by the Bishop of Exeter.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>The rocks of the southern part of this parish resemble
those of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ervan, but near the church a lamelar blue
slate prevails, like that of Endellion, and like it also
abounding in veins of the sulphurets of lead and of antimony.</p>

<p><!--186.png--><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a><span class="pageno">180</span>
The western part of the parish, which extends into the
sea, forming a promontory called Trevose Head, is composed
of crystalline rocks, which are massive, and differ
from all the rocks that are interposed between it and the
granite of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dennis. Both the composition and the relative
situation of these rocks are very interesting. They
appear to be the equivalents of the masses of serpentine of
Clicker Tor, and of the Lizard district; of the felspathic
rocks which form the downs between Launceston and Davidstow;
and of that curious mass of rock at King Arthur’s
Castle, in Tintagel. Geologists have yet to learn the precise
relation of these crystalline masses with the calcareous
series in which they are situated.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head">MERTHYR.</h3>

<p class="p2 center small">HALS.</p>

<p>Merthyr, Murder, vicarage, is situated in the hundred
of Powder, and hath upon the north and east Probus and
Tresilian river, south Lamoran and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael Penkivell,
west an arm of Falmouth Harbour, towards Clemens. As
for the name, it refers to the tutelar patron and guardian
saint of the church, who it seems was murdered and slain
for the Christian religion, as a martyr; <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> one <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cohan,
a Briton of this parish, whose little well, and consecrated
chapel annexed thereto, was lately extant, upon the lands
of Egles Merthyr barton, (that is to say upon the lands of
the Martyr’s Church,) though now in a manner demolished
by greedy searchers for money.</p>

<p>This church goes in presentation and consolidation as a
daughter to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Probus, which vicar is to present the curate,
vicar, or chaplain of Merthyr to the Bishop for licence
and confirmation; though the eight men of the said
parish are by ancient custom to choose and name him, in
<!--187.png--><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a><span class="pageno">181</span>
consideration whereof the vicar of Probus is to receive annually
from them, on the high altar, three shillings and
four pence.</p>

<p>However, great controversies have happened in the
Bishop’s Consistory between the vicar of Probus and the
inhabitants of this parish, before and since Henry the
Eighth’s days, upon the death, removal, or translations of
the vicar of Probus, concerning the right of the jurisdiction,
presentation, or patronage of this church; whether in the
vicar of Probus, or the eight men of the said parish, the
vicar presenting one clerk or curate to be confirmed by the
Bishop, and the eight men another; but generally it hath
passed as a rule in the Ecclesiastical Court, where this matter,
by learned counsel or proctors, hath been debated, that the
right of patronage and presentation of this church lay in
the eight men of the parish, and not in the vicar of Probus,
though the same hath been often controverted.</p>

<p>There is a Latin deed which I have seen yet extant, between
Bar. Combe, vicar-general to Dr. Peter Courtenay,
Lord Bishop of Exeter, 1480, under seal of the diocese,
and John Fullford, perpetual vicar of Probus of the one
part, and Thomas Tresithney, John Hallvose, Thomas
Webber, and others of the eight men of the parish of
Merthyr on the other part, wherein those premises are
concerted or regulated; and moreover, therein a confirmation,
covenant, or agreement, made and established between
them, according to ancient custom; that in case the
said eight men and their successors should annually pay to
the vicar or curate of the said parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cohan Martyr,
of Merthyr, for ever annually the full and just sum of
twenty marks lawful moneys of England, that then the lands
of the said parish, and every part and parcel thereof should
be exempt and free from the payment of small tithes in
kind, oblations, or obventions to the vicar thereof for ever.
Which privilege hath ever since been kept and enjoyed
by the inhabitants of the said parish accordingly; to the
great loss of the vicar, and greater gain of the inhabitants.</p>

<p><!--188.png--><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a><span class="pageno">182</span>
Now, though when this compact was made and confirmed,
the vicar had much the better bargain, not one
vicarage church in Cornwall being of that value in the
King’s or Pope’s Books towards Annats in the first inquisition,
1294, nor many in Wolsey’s Inquisition, 1520;
yet now the inhabitants have great profit thereby, since
the plenty or commonness of money lessens the intrinsic
value thereof, whereby much number of money will buy
but little lands, goods, or chattels, whereas in those days a
little quantity of money would purchase much of those
things. (Witness Baker, and other our chronologers, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr>
Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> soon after the compact aforesaid was made,
wherein we may read that a bushel of wheat, Winchester
measure, was sold for 6<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span>, a bushel of salt for 3½<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span>, a ton of
Gascoign wines 40<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span>, and all other things sold after a proportionable
price.)</p>

<p>In the Domesday Book, 1087, this district was taxed
under the jurisdiction of Penkivell. Afterwards, upon the
setting up the vicarage of Probus, it was concerted into
that parish about the beginning of King Henry the Third’s
days; for in the Inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln and
Winchester, into the value of Cornish Benefices, 1294, its
superior or mother church was rated for it, as also the five
chaplains for their salaries, that officiated in Probus, Cornelly,
and Merthyr. It was endowed by the treasurer of
the cathedral church of Exeter, which must be after that
dignitary was first set up there, by William Brewar, Bishop
thereof 1224. The patronage as aforesaid; the incumbent,
Monsieur Baudree, a French Protestant; and the parish
rated to the 4<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> per pound Land Tax, 1696, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> William
<abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> £83.</p>

<p>At Tre-saws-an, alias Tre-saus-an, id est, the Saxon
town, or dwelling, a place heretofore pertaining to some
Saxon, is the possession by lease of James Hals, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr>,
granted him by his mother in the time of her widowhood,
as parcel of the manor of Fentongollan, whereon she had
power of leasing during her widowhood. He was a younger
<!--189.png--><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span class="pageno">183</span>
son of Sir Nicholas Hals, of Fentongollan, Knight, by
Grace his wife, daughter of Sir John Arundell, of Talverne,
Knight; and was first bred a soldier in Pendenis
Castle, whereof his father was Governor, under King
James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> and Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> Afterwards he was made lieutenant
of his brother Captain William Hals, in the expedition
of the Duke of Buckingham in the French war, at the
Isle of Rhé and Rochelle. And after that war was over
was sent with his said brother by King Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> with a foot
company of soldiers to supply or reinforce the garrisons of
the Barbadoes, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Christopher’s, and Mountserat Islands
in America, where he remained about seven years; and
after his brother’s death, who died returning into England,
Captain Ayleworth was displaced, and the said James
Hals made Governor of Mountserat Island, by King
Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr></p>

<p>After which, the wars breaking out in England, between
that King and his Parliament, he and divers other officers
were commanded to return back into England for the
King’s service; where soon after his arrival at Plymouth,
that stood for the Parliament, then besieged by the King’s
army, he was cajoled out of his allegiance to King Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
by his country gentlemen then in that place in garrison,
and engaged against that King, to become Lieutenant-Colonel
to Colonel Nicholas Boscawen’s troop of horse,
then posted there. From whence he was commanded, with
several other troops of horse, to go outside the lines, under
conduct of the Earl of Stamford, then Governor of Plymouth
for the Parliament, and to fight the King’s army
that besieged it under conduct of Sir Ralph Hopton,
Knight, and Sir Richard Grenvill, Knight and Baronet, the
King’s Generals in the West; where, after a sharp engagement
and loss of many men between both parties, the victory
fell to the King’s army; and then and there the said
James Hals, and many other gentlemen were taken prisoners
of war, and forthwith sent prisoners to Lidford
<!--190.png--><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a><span class="pageno">184</span>
Castle in Devon, under custody of Marshall Ellery, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Colomb Major.</p>

<p>Where soon after several of his companions, or fellow
officers and soldiers, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Mr. Leach, Mr. Morris, Mr. Brabyn,
and others, were executed without trial or judgment,
as guilty of high treason. But the said James Hals had
his life spared or given him by the General Sir Richard
Grenville, Knight, upon account of consanguinity, but not
without many frowns and angry threats; (a sure token of
his clemency, as his smiles and embraces were of death and
destruction, suitable to those of King Richard <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> and
King James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> and Caius Caligula, Emperor of Rome,)
to dissuade him from the Parliament service to that of the
King’s, with promise of greater preferment in his army;
all which proving ineffectual, he was sentenced a straight
or close prisoner to that tremendous castle, in daily expectation
of death; where he remained immured up for about
twenty months space, in great want, durance, and misery,
till General Essex came into those parts with the Parliament
army, and set at liberty him and other Lidford prisoners,
by Captain Braydon raised the siege of Plymouth,
and sore distressed Hopton and Grenville in Cornwall.</p>

<p>During the time of this James Hals’ imprisonment in
Lidford Castle, amongst others there came to visit him
one Mr. Doctor William Brown, of Tavistock, who gave
him a copy of rambling verses and observations he had
made upon the borough and castle of Lidford, for his diversion;
which verses, for want of the original, I find false
and imperfectly set forth and printed in Mr. Prince’s
Worthies of Devon, therefore I have hereunder set it down

<p>This custom of executing malefactors before trial on
common fame, was also an old law amongst the Germans
and Swiss Cantons; and if upon trial, after execution done
on the criminal, he or she appeared to be innocent, a priest
was appointed to pray for his soul. (See Glover’s Somerset,
and Duverdier’s History of the Swiss Cantons.)</p>

<p>The same law was in force amongst the people of Carinthia,
a country adjoining to the Alps and Italy on the
south, and Styria on the north; moreover, if upon the
trial three days after the offender’s execution, he appeared
to be guilty, his body should be left so long to hang upon
the gibbet, till his members rotted piecemeal from his body.
But if innocent they took it thence and gave it venerable
obsequies, with prayers, oblations, and alms deed for the
salvation of his soul.</p>

practitioner in physic, who took the degree of Doctor
beyond the seas, at Leyden in Holland I take it. He
now resideth at London, where he married &mdash;&mdash;, and hath
got himself considerable wealth and reputation in his profession.
He had also issue Nathaniel Halsey, bred a merchant,
and is now a factor for the East India Company, at
Bombay or Bengal in India; also Edward Halsey, of the
same occupation, now a factor for the said Company at
Surat, or some other part of India; also a daughter, married

<p>Trevilian bridge is the most remarkable spot in this
parish. It is situated in a beautiful valley, with a fine
stream navigable for barges from Falmouth, which conveys
large quantities of limestone from Plymouth, and of coast
sand dredged in Falmouth harbour.</p>

<p>In consequence also of the new line of road, completed
about four years ago from Bodmin, and therefore from
London to Truro, through Ladock valley, the Earl of Falmouth
has made a private road to his own house, from the
eastern end of this bridge, equal perhaps in beauty to any
drive of an equal extent in the whole county. Some fairs
are annually holden at this place, and it is recorded in
history as the place where the treaty was agreed on for the
surrender of the army of about five thousand men, commanded
by Lord Hopton, then lying in Truro, to the
troops of General Fairfax, on the 14th of March 1646.</p>

<p>The church is very small, and, what is quite unusual in
Cornwall, has a wooden edifice, it cannot be called a tower,
to contain its single bell.</p>

Penwarne in this parish heretofore, if not now, the voke
lands of some manor, (as I take it still it is,) gave name
and original to an old family of gentlemen, surnamed de
Penwarne; whose daughter and heir, together with herself,
carried those lands to Cosowarth, by whose heiress it
passed to Otwell Hill, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> that married Denham, descended
from the Hills of Lancashire; who gave for his
arms, Gules, a chevron between three garbs Ermine; from
whose heir it passed, by sale or descent, to John Carew,
merchant, that married Hellman, who by her had issue
only five daughters: 1. married to Lewis Tremayne, of
Halligan, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>; 2. Candia, to Hugh Trevanion, of Treligan,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>; 3. Grace, the youngest daughter, was married

<p>The church, which is a very indifferent low building,
consists of a nave only, with one north aisle and a cross aisle
to the south. There was formerly a square tower at the
western end with three bells, which being something out
of repair, they pulled it down in the rebellious times, and
sold the bells, which turned (as all such sacrilegious actions
ought to do) to the utter undoing of all those concerned
in it; there remaineth however one bell in that part of the
tower which is standing, even in height with the roof of
the church.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.
<!--198.png--><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a><span class="pageno">192</span></p>

<p>Mr. Tonkin has written much more on this parish than
on most others, but the details relative to families, and to
individuals long since forgotten, and never of any distinction,
are quite uninteresting.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons has abridged it to the following effect, intermixed
with additions of his own.</p>

<p>Tonkin says that Mevagissey, lately a poor fishing
village, contained in his time two hundred houses; that a
pier had been constructed at the expense of the Trewolla
family; that it was the most convenient place on the coast
for the pilchard fishery; that on an average twelve thousand
hogsheads were cured annually. The present number of
houses is about 370. The eastern part of the town, which
in old deeds is called Porthilly, belongs to the Hoblyns;
the middle part to the Grenvilles, of Stowe in Buckinghamshire,
as parcel of the manor of Trelevan; the western
part is included in Mr. Tremayne’s manor of Penwarne.</p>

<p>Ships of 100 tons burden may ride securely in the pool.
The fishing cove of Porthmellin is partly in this parish.</p>

<p>The manor of Trelevan belonged for several generations
to the family of Trewolla, of Trewolla in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Goran. It
was by them sold, about the year 1667, to Walter Vincent,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Truro, who in 1680 was appointed one of the
Barons of the Exchequer, but died on his way to London
before he had been sworn into that high office. His grandson
Nicholas Vincent, who died in 1726, mortgaged this
estate, the manor of Tregavethan in Kenwyn, and the
greater part of his property, to John Knight, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Gosfield
Hall in Essex. This gentleman’s widow married Lord
Nugent, whose only daughter and heiress carried the whole
to the Grenvilles, now Dukes of Buckingham.</p>

<p>The barton of Trelevan was successively the seat of the
families of Croome and Stevens, as lessees under the Trewollas.
The Vincents, having bought in the lease, made it
their residence; and, after the decease of the last of the
<!--199.png--><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a><span class="pageno">193</span>
Vincent’s, Mr. Tonkin resided there for some time, being
the heir-at-law, but the property was too much incumbered
for him to retain the freehold.</p>

<p>The manor of Pentuan was the property and its barton
the chief seat of the Pentires, after they removed from
Pentire in Endellion. The heiress of Pentire married
Roscarrock, from whom this estate passed by a marriage
to the Darts, of Dart Ralph in Devonshire, who sold it to
Robarts, of Lanhidrock; and the last Earl of Radnor bequeathed
it to Mr. James Laroche, a merchant of Bristol,
afterwards created a Baronet. This gentleman becoming
insolvent, sold the manor, together with a large property
scattered over Cornwall, to a friend, who soon afterwards
dying restored the whole by his will; but in a little while,
and as it would seem with the intention of guarding against
the possibility of a similar occurrence, the estate was sold
a second time in parcels; when this manor of Pentire was
purchased by the late Mr. Tremayne, of Heligon, and the
barton, which was reserved by Mr. Dart when he sold the
manor, has descended to Mr. Tremayne from that family.</p>

<p>The manor of Penwarne belonged to an ancient family
of that name. Vivian Penwarne, who died in the reign of
Henry the Seventh, left three daughters, coheiresses, married
to Cosworth, Penhallow, and Penwarne, of Penwarne
in Mawnan. The elder daughter inherited this manor,
which passed in marriage with the heiress of Coswarth to
Alan Hill, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> There is a monument in the church to
his son Otwell Hill, of Penwarne; after his death the
estate passed to a nephew, Mr. John Carew, second son of
Richard Carew, of Anthony, the Historian of Cornwall.</p>

<p>Mr. John Carew distinguished himself at the siege of
Ostend, in 1601, where he lost his right hand by a cannon
ball. His only son John died in 1640, leaving five sisters,
one of whom married Fortescue, in whom this property
continued till within recent times: it is now, however, sold
in lots.</p>

<p><!--200.png--><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a><span class="pageno">194</span>
The barton of Trewincy, sometime a leasehold seat of
the Sprys, is now a farmhouse, the property of Mr. Tremayne.</p>

<p>The vicarage is endowed with the great tithes of about one
third part of the parish. The remainder of the great tithes
has gone with the manor of Treleven to the Grenvelles.
The patronage of the vicarage belongs to the Edgcumbe
family, of Mount Edgcumbe; the whole were formerly appropriated
to the college of Glaseney at Penryn.</p>

<p>Mevagissey is one of the principal stations for taking of
pilchards by seine nets, if it is not the very first. The bay
is sheltered, free from rocks, and of a depth which allows
the leads on one edge of the net to rest on the smooth sand
at the bottom, while the other edge is raised to the surface
by corks.</p>

<p>All fish are by custom in this parish liable to tithes,
which are payable to the vicar, and amount in some years
to much more than the ordinary income of the living.</p>

<p>The vicarage house is very pleasantly situated in a valley
rising from the town, and the whole glebe received great
improvements from the late vicar, Doctor Lyne, a gentleman
of much respectability, but most distinguished by his
singularities; among other fancies, he entertained such
strong apprehensions and fear of contagion, as not to touch
even gold coin till it had been flung into water; but this
caution seems to have been compensated by a subsequent
attachment to the precious metal, as several thousand
pounds in specie were found in his house.</p>

<p>A market is held in Mevagissey on Saturdays.</p>

<p>This parish measures 1222 statute acres.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Mr. Hals has given several etymologies of the word Mewan,
but so little probable as not to merit attention. It
may be the name of a missionary, as is the case in so many
other parishes.</p>

<p>The church does not present any thing remarkable, except
a pleasing appearance among trees at a short distance
north of the turnpike road leading from Truro to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Austell, just where a hill has been lowered, and a valley
raised within these few years, to the very great improvement
of the line of communication westward from Plymouth.
A son of our eminently distinguished countryman
Doctor William Borlase, was presented to this living by
Mr. Christopher Hawkins, of Trewinnard. His grandson
is now at the head of that ancient family.</p>

<p><!--203.png--><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a><span class="pageno">197</span>
The object of most curiosity in this parish is Polgeoth
mine, one of those wrought through the greatest length of
time, and with the greatest produce of tin, in the whole
county.</p>

<p>Pol-gooth is in Cornish the old pit or mine. Mr. Hals
mentions, as a matter of astonishment, its having produced
above five hundred thousand pounds weight of tin
in less than forty years, and that it paid a fifth dish or
share to the proprietor of the soil. Nothing can more
clearly evince the enlarged scale of working in modern
times; 500,000 pounds weight of tin in forty years would
give an average of 12,500 pounds weight for each year, and
at the recent price of four pounds sterling for a hundred
weight of tin, about £2,200 a year. In some of the later
workings perhaps thirty or forty thousand pounds have
been expended in an outfit, or what is called bringing the
mine into a course of working, in the purchase of steam
engines, and of various other elaborate machines; and instead
of paying a fifth part of whatever minerals are raised,
free of expense to the proprietors of the soil, an eighteenth
or perhaps a twenty-fourth share is all that can reasonably
be demanded or afforded after such an outlay of capital,
which small share, however, usually amounts to a greater
value than did the fifth or sixth part received in former
times.</p>

<p>The manor and village of Burngullo belonged to the
Robarts’s, of Lanhidrock, and have descended to Mrs. Agar.</p>

<p>The manor of Trewoon belongs partly to the family of
Hawkins, and partly to Tremayne and Hoblyn.</p>

<p>The northern part of this parish extends over the central
mass of granite, in the form of a long narrow stripe,
the base of which is about one mile north of the church.
All the remainder of the parish consists of compact and
schistose felspar rocks, traversed by beds of porphyry, and
intersected by numerous veins of tin and copper, more particularly
of tin. On the whole, this parish bears a very
close geological resemblance to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell.</p>

of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester, into
the value of Cornish Benefices, 1294, this church was not
endowed, if extant; afterwards it was, by the Cornwalls,
Hendowers, or Tregarthins, of Court in Branell, and dedicated
to God in the name and honour of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael the

<p>Tre-vanion, alias Tre-vanyon, in this parish, which place
gave name and original to an old British and knightly
family of gentlemen, surnamed de Trevanyon, now in possession
thereof, and also of Cary-hayes aforesaid; which
latter came to those gentlemen’s ancestors by marriage
with the daughter and heir of Arundell, lord thereof, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr>
Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>; since which time they have flourished, at
Cary-hayes and Trevanion in great fame, wealth, and reputation
in their country. Who have also had bestowed
upon them, as tradition saith, by their princes, for their
good services, the lands of several rebels and traitors, forfeited
by attainder of treason, in those parts; in the York
and Lancaster wars, and Flamock’s, Arundell’s, and other
Cornish rebellions.</p>

<p>Of this family was Witte, or William, Trevanion, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>
Sheriff of Cornwall 17 Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> 1503; Witte, or Sir
William, Trevanion, knight, was Sheriff of Cornwall the

Cornwall 6th of Elizabeth, 1564; who had issue Charles
Trevanion, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> that married the daughter and heir of
Witchalse, descended from Benet Witchalse, Steward of
Exeter 1440, Sheriff of Cornwall 37th of Elizabeth, 1595;
he had issue by her Charles Trevanion, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> Sheriff of
Cornwall 9 Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> and by him knighted; who had issue
John Trevanion, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> that married Anne, daughter of
John Arundell, of Trerice, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> slain on the part of King
Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> at Lansdown; by whom he had issue Amey,
<!--206.png--><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a><span class="pageno">200</span>
married to Joseph Sawle, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> and Charles Trevanion,
<abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> Member of Parliament for Tregony, that married one
of the coheirs of Sir William Drummond, knight, by the

knight; by whom he had issue John Trevanion, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>
twice chosen one of the Shire Knights for this county in
Parliament, now living, that married Anne, daughter of Sir
Francis Blake, knight. Charles Trevanion, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> had also
issue a son, educated beyond the seas, who entered into
Holy Orders after the doctrine and discipline of Rome, as
I am informed.</p>

<p>The arms of these gentlemen are, in a field Argent, a
fess Azure, charged with three escallops Or, between two
chevronels Gules; which arms I suppose heretofore were
the arms of two distinct families, and for some peculiar
reason united.</p>

<p>This parish has its name from the Archangel, conjoined
to that of the principal place in it.</p>

<p class="p2 center smaller">THE MANOR OF CARHAYES.</p>

<p>The name of this place is derived from caer, a castle, a
house, or dwelling, and hay a hazel hedge, as the situation
does plainly make out; and did much more so before the
great alterations which Mr. Trevanion hath lately made
here.</p>

<p>I have reason to believe that this place was part of Carminow’s
lands, and that it came into the Arundell family
on the match with Jane, the eldest daughter of Sir Thomas
Carminow, in the reign of Edward the Third. Of this
family, in recent times, Col. John Trevanion was killed in
his father’s lifetime, at the head of his regiment before
Bristol, whose character may be seen in Clarendon. His
father, Sir Charles Trevanion, was a very worthy honest
gentleman, and suffered much for the king’s cause, to the
<!--207.png--><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a><span class="pageno">201</span>
great detriment of his estate, and dying before the Restoration,
lived not long enough to have those amends made to
his family, which his own merits and their losses deserved.
Col. John Trevanion married Anne, daughter of John
Arundell, of Trerice, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> by whom he had a numerous
issue, and among the rest Richard Trevanion, a famous sea
commander, under King Charles the Second, and King
James the Second, with which last he went to France, and
died there in exile. The said Anne, his mother, was afterwards
remarried to Sir John Arundell, of Lanherne, by
whom she had not any issue.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Trevanion was succeeded by his grandson, of
the same name, who first married the daughter and coheir
of Sir Adam Drummond, by the heiress of the Lowers of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Winnow, and had two sons. He died on the night of
the great storm, <abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 26, 1703; being succeeded by his
eldest son, John Trevanion, who first married Anne, one
of the daughters and coheirs of Sir Francis Blake, of Ford
Castle in Northumberland, by whom he had no issue;
and secondly Barbara, the daughter of William Lord
Berkeley of Stratton, by whom he has one son William,
and two daughters, all very young. Mr. John Trevanion
has been three times elected knight of the shire for this
county, in the 9th and 12th of Queen Ann, and in the 1st
of King George the First.</p>

<p>He has bestowed a great deal of money in buildings,
gardens, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> on this place; but as there is nothing of regularity
observed, it may more properly be called a pleasant
romantic seat than a complete habitation; and although it
faces the south, yet it lies too much under an hill, and is
therefore cold and damp in winter. The house anciently
stood to the north of the present, towards the brow of the
hill, according to my opinion in a far better situation.
The place where it was built is still called the haller, that
is the hall; but the odd desire of our ancestors to settle in
our vallies, and to get, as they called it, in <em>the luthe</em>, inclined
one of the Arundells to remove the house to where
<!--208.png--><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a><span class="pageno">202</span>
it now stands, and that was done so long since that nothing
remains but the name to point out this ancient dwelling.</p>

<p>Trevanion, formerly written Trevagnion, that is, the
town or dwelling in an hollow, gave name and was the
ancient inheritance of this very eminent family, which they
left on their marriage with Arundell’s heiress, for Carhayes.
The house at Trevanion is now so wholly destroyed,
that it would be hard to guess where it stood, had
not the footsteps of two or three ways leading towards it
pointed out the former situation. The park is at this
place, and not at Carhayes, being well wooded, and having
a fine river flowing through it. A portion of the park is
in the parish of Gorran, called by the name of Porown
Berry, and paying a quit-rent to the duchy manor of Trevennen,
out of which it plainly appears to have been taken.</p>

<p>Hurris, or Herys, was formerly the seat of a knightly
family, of which family I believe was Henricus de Herys,
mentioned by Carew to have held a knight’s fee in the
reign of Richard the First.</p>

<p>Near to this place is Treberrick, the fruitful or fertile
town. Treberrick in this parish (for there is another
place of the same name in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ewe) carries with it not
only the advowson of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael Carhayes, but also of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Stephen’s, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dennis in Branwell. It was sold by
John Tanner, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> to Charles Trevanion, of Carhayes.
This place is now the seat, under lease, of Simon Slade,
<abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> a younger brother of the late Mr. William Slade, of
Trevennen. Mr. Simon Slade was twice married, first to
one of the daughters of Mr. Thomas Hancock, of Pengelly
in Creed, and not having any surviving children, he married
secondly the daughter of Stephen Thomas, of Tregamena
in Verian, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> by whom he has two sons and two
daughters.</p>

<p>The church is but small: being seated however on a hill,
it is a good sea mark. This church consists of a nave, a
south aisle extending about half its length, a north cross
aisle, and a small confessionary to the north of the chancel.
<!--209.png--><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a><span class="pageno">203</span>
The tower is low and without pinnacles, provided with
three bells.</p>

<p>A broken flat stone in the chancel has this inscription
round its margin:</p>

<p>Here lyeth the bodie of Mr. Zacharie Hooker, of this
parish rector, who was buried yᵉ <span class="muchsmaller">XXV</span> day of <abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 1643.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The ancient and respectable family of Trevanion, like
all others able to trace themselves back, in influential situations,
to remote periods, has experienced the vicissitudes
arising from civil dissensions. In those times it is quite
clear, that love of plunder, and eagerness after confiscations,
must have been the sole motives of action on either
side; since, trifling as have been the causes of domestic as
well as of foreign wars, no one can believe that, in the absence
of all contested political principles, men could be
found who would deluge their country with blood for the
sake of seating on the throne an individual whose name
was Edward instead of another designated as Henry, on
the frivolous pretence, that, had England been a farm, and
its inhabitants farm stock, one of the parties possessed a
claim through females superior to the other, if it were not
defeated by legal fiction, or by the lapse of time.</p>

<p>In such a conflict three families at the least from Cornwall
were engaged, Bodrigan, Trevanion, and Edgecumbe;
and when Richard the Third obtained sovereign
power, on the division which then look place in the York
<!--210.png--><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a><span class="pageno">204</span>
faction, Bodrigan endeavoured to seize the property of
Edgcumbe, with little respect, as it would seem, for the
life of the possessor; but in the final struggle at Bosworth
Field, where Henry Tudor put an entire end to this contest
for power under the guise of property, by seizing the
whole to himself, Trevanion and Edgcumbe had the
good fortune to appear on the winning side, and subsequently
availed themselves to the utmost of belligerent
rights against Bodrigan, as he had attempted to do before
against them. The last of that family was driven from his
home, and seems to have perished in exile. His property
was divided between the two families opposed to him, and
after the lapse of three hundred and fifty years continues
to form a large portion of their respective possessions.</p>

<p>At a subsequent period, when wars were levied in support
of principles, and when men of honour and of virtue
engaged on either side, as their early prejudices, investigations,
or accidental experience induced them to believe that
one or the other would prove most conducive to the public
good&mdash;the Trevanions were less successful. They asserted
their conviction in arms, that the country would be best governed
by concentrating hereditary power in a single man;
and Mr. John Trevanion, bearing a Colonel’s commission,
shared in the military glories of the western army, and fell
under the walls of Bristol. His father experienced the
mitigated fate of those who were vanquished in this contest,
by compounding for his estate; and when, after a long interval,
his friends came again into power, and succeeded
in placing at the head of affairs the son of their former
chief, those immediately surrounding the seat of government
possessed but slender means, and still less inclination,
to risk their own safety by indemnifying those at a distance,
who had suffered in the Good Old Cause.</p>

<p>The grandson obtained however the popular reward of
representing Cornwall in parliament; and the Editor has
in his possesssion a letter addressed by Mr. John Trevanion
to his great uncle Mr. Henry Davies, a hundred and
<!--211.png--><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a><span class="pageno">205</span>
twenty-five years ago, declaring his readiness to spend his
fortune and to shed his blood, as his ancestors had done, in
support of the same cause. This gentleman died in 1740,
leaving William Trevanion his son and heir, and two
daughters, the eldest of whom married John Bettesworth,
<abbr title="Doctor of Laws">LL.D.</abbr> Dean of the Arches, and the younger married Admiral
John Byron, well known in his younger days by a
narrative of the disastrous expedition of the Wager Store
ship, commanded by Captain Cheep, as a part of the fleet
conducted by Commodore Anson round the promontory of
South America, in the year 1740, and of his own adventures
after the ship was wrecked on the coast of Patagonia,
the dead reckoning giving them an erroneous longitude of
fifteen degrees to the west, till his return in 1746. Admiral
Byron is now better known as grandfather to the
most popular of recent poets.</p>

<p>William Trevanion served in parliament for the borough
of Tregoney, and died in 1767 without children, when the
male line of this family became extinct. He was succeeded
by Mr. John Bettesworth, his sister’s son, and his
son John Trevanion Purnel Bettesworth Trevanion, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>
is now the possessor of Carhayes, where he has substituted
a magnificent gothic castle, after a plan of Nash, the architect
of Buckingham Palace and of Regent Street, for
the house described by Mr. Tonkin.</p>

<p>Mr. Trevanion married early in life, and was left a
widower with several children. He has for his second wife
Miss Burdett, daughter of the individual to whom the
country mainly owes the great alteration in the constitution
of its government, on the ultimate effects of which no
one is yet qualified to form even a conjecture, still less an
opinion.</p>

<p>The family of Bettesworth have been settled on the
manor of Fyning, a part of Rogate parish in Sussex, since
about the year 1570; and a pedigree of nine descents is
given in Dallaway’s History of the Rape of Chichester,
ending with Thomas Bettesworth, who assumed the name
<!--212.png--><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a><span class="pageno">206</span>
of Bilson in 1740, and died in 1754, aged 58. This gentleman
bequeathed a life interest in his property to Thomas
Bettesworth, of Chithurst, and after his decease gave it to
Henry Legge, fourth son of William Legge, first Earl of
Dartmouth, on condition of taking the name of Bilson.</p>

<p>Mr. Henry Bilson Legge married Mary Stawel, daughter
and heir of Edward Stawel, Lord Stawel, and was in
consequence himself created Lord Stawel in 1760. They
were succeeded by their son Henry Stawel Bilson Legge,
who died in 1820.</p>

<p>The parish of Rogate is situated between Petersfield and
Midhurst, on the bank of a small river, which (after watering
Selborne, a name made familiar to every one by the
admirable work of its vicar, Mr. White,) flows into the
county of Sussex, and joining the Arun, finally reaches
the sea through Arundale, a name mistaken by the Normans
for that of a swallow.</p>

<p>The manor of Fyning belonged to a monastery of Premonstratensian
Canons, founded at Dureford, an adjacent
parish, about the year 1160, by Henry Hosatus, or Husey,
and augmented three hundred years afterwards by Henry
Guldeford. It was surrendered to King Henry the Eighth,
by John Simpson, the last superior. Temporary grants were
made of the lands, till they were finally bestowed in fee
on Sir Edmund Merwyn, a gentleman of Sussex, from
whose descendants they passed to the Bettesworths.</p>

<p>In the church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael Carhayes are several monuments
to the Trevanions, and pieces of armour, the trophies
of former days; also a sword, believed to have been
the very one used by Sir Hugh Trevanion at Bosworth
Field.</p>

<p>Etymologies, deceptive at all times, become so in a tenfold
degree when they are sought in the varying pronunciations
of an unwritten language. But car, caer, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> are
known (like Rocca in the Italian) to mean a fortress, a
castellated house, a dwelling; and hay, running colloquially
into hayes, is an enclosed fence or yard. Carhayes may
<!--213.png--><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a><span class="pageno">207</span>
therefore signify the castle surrounded by a basse court or

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Saint">ST.</abbr> MICHAEL PENKEVIL.</h3>

<p class="p2 center small">HALS.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael Penkevil rectory is situate in the hundred
of Powder, and hath upon the north and east Merther and
Lammoran, and is otherwise wholly encompassed with the
sea arm of Falmouth harbour, that extends towards Tregony,
Truro, and Tresilian bridges. At the time of the
Norman Conquest there was an endowed church extant
in this place, for then this district was taxed under the
<!--214.png--><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a><span class="pageno">208</span>
jurisdiction of Penkevil, of which more under. Neither
had it any other appellation at the time of the Inquisition
into the value of Cornish Benefices, so often mentioned,
1294, than Ecclesia de Penkevill, in decanatu de Powdre;
and was valued at 40<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> Which probably was extant, as
aforesaid, before the Norman Conquest, and held its name
to that time; but afterwards, when the present church was
rebuilt or augmented in the place thereof in the form of a
cross, and was one of the quarter cathedrals of the Cornish
diocese, it was then dedicated to God in the name of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Michael the Archangel, and is commonly called <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael
Penkivell church, as under. In Wolsey’s Inquisition,
1521, it was valued for its first fruits £9. 14<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 0½. The
patronage formerly in Tregago, Trenowth, Carmenow,
Hals, now Boscawen; the incumbent Hillman; and the parish
rated to the 4<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> per pound Land Tax, 1596, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> William
<abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> £83. 8<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> by the name of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael Penkivell.
This church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael was endowed by the Fentongollans,
or de Tregagos, lords of the manor of Fentongollan,
upon whose lands it was built (out of which is since
taken the manor of Tregothnan), who also at their own
proper cost and charges, built the south chapel or aisle
thereof, as a peculiar to them and their families, and
obliged those lands for ever to repair the same, (both over
and under) as they still do. Besides this they founded in
this church a chantry, together with a convent house in the
churchyard still extant, for the chanter’s residence; and
endowed the same with competent lands for their subsistence,
to pray for the souls of them and their ancestors,
that after death they might be delivered from the flames of
purgatory, and transported into heaven; now these funeral
songs or offices for the dead are commonly called obits.</p>

<p>By the statute 27 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> also 1 Edward <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> all
chantrys, colleges, free chapels and hospitals, were given to
the king; at which time John Carmenow, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> obtained
by gift or purchase the grant of this chantry from the
crown, and annexed it, together with its lands and revenues,
to the manor of Fentongollan, out of which at first
<!--215.png--><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a><span class="pageno">209</span>
it was taken; all of which at length John Hals, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> lord
of the manor, together with the patronage of this church,
sold to Hugh Boscawen, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></p>

<p>Fenton-gollan, Venton gollan, was and is the voke lands
of a considerable manor, which heretofore comprehended
the whole parishes of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael Penkevil and Merther;
except the tenements of Penkevill, Tregothnan, (Treganyan,
Penhell, Eglesmerther, and some others,) now as
above subdivided into the manors of Tregothnan and Fentongollan;
which latter had heretofore upon its lands many
large and commodious houses, as halls, parlours, and dining rooms,
a notable tower and bell, three stories high, and a
chapel adjoining thereto for divine service, and two large
gatehouses at each end of the town, which fabric the
writer hereof hath often seen in his youth, when his grandmother
lived in it, and enjoyed the same lordship, together
with the manor of Bohurro, alias <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony, as her jointure
or freehold for life. But now, alas! since her death,
those lands have been sold and transferred to several
persons by her son John Hals, and those houses are all
pulled down, and the chief stones thereof carried to build
the gates and houses of Tregothnan.</p>

<p>This lordship, as I have been informed, soon after the
Norman Conquest passed from the family from thence denominated
de Fentongollan, to that of Tregaga, or Tresaga
aforesaid, who for many generations were gentlemen
of great fame and wealth, and in all probability were so
denominated from Tregaga, or Tregage, house and tower,
or castle, yet extant at Ruan Lanyhorne.</p>

<p>In the rector’s chancel or chapel of this church is yet
to be seen a marble tombstone, with this inscription on it:
Here lieth the body of John Trembraze, Master of Art
and Law, and sometime rector of this church, who departed
this life 12 November 1503, upon whose soul Jesus
have mercy. Trembraze is a place in Leskeard parish.</p>

<p>This church, as I said before, being a quarter cathedral
<!--216.png--><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a><span class="pageno">210</span>
to the Bishop of Exeter, the old bells in this tower of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Michael Penkevil were baptized, as appears from their
names subscribed in them, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary; the
manner of which baptizing bells was thus: After the bell
was cast and set up in the tower, the suffragan bishop called
the chief inhabitants of the parish together to be godfathers
and godmothers of the bell; who all holding the rope in
their hand after prayers, the suffragan demanded the name
of the bell of them, which being given he sprinkles water
upon him or it, saying, “Michael, I baptise thee in the name
of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost; be thou
henceforth efficacious in driving thunder, lightning, evil
spirits, and tempest, from the living and the dead in this
place;” whereupon the gossips toll the bell; having prepared
a new white garment, then put it upon the bell
(as was used to be done amongst new baptized Christians
of the primitive church) afterwards a great banquet is prepared
by the gossips for the suffragan, his chaplains, and
ministers, who are there fed and rewarded. Now it is a
doubtful question amongst the canonists whether the gossips
to such bells may marry with each other afterwards by canonical
law. (See also to this purpose Fox’s Acts and
Monuments, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 84.)</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael Penkevil is in the hundred of Powder, and
is surrounded to the west and south by branches of the
river Fale.</p>

<p>This parish hath the adjunct of Penkivell from Penkivell
therein, although I should think it ought rather to
have had that of Fentongollan, since that always, till of
late, hath been the principal place in this parish, and the
patronage of it belonged thereto. I shall therefore in the
first place treat of the manor of Fentongollan.</p>

<p>The name of this manor does not bear the meaning assigned
<!--217.png--><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a><span class="pageno">211</span>
to it by Mr. Carew, but it signifies the holy well.
The Saint’s well of the parish being on the barton. But
note that a part of the barton, and the greater portion of
the manor, are in the adjoining parish of Merthyr; but as
the house is wholly in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael Penkevil, this is the
most proper parish wherein to treat of it.</p>

<p>Fentongollan has been the seat of several considerable
families; the first that I meet with as lord of this place is
John de Trejago, or Trejano, Sheriff of Cornwall in the
time of Edward the Second, whose son Stephen Trejago
left an only daughter Jane, married to John Trenoweth, of
Trenoweth, in whose posterity it continued, and was their
principal residence till about the middle of the reign of
Edward the Fourth, when John Trenoweth, of this place,
left four daughters and coheiresses.</p>

<p>Philippa, married to John Carminow, who obtained with
her this place.</p>

<p>Maud, married to Thomas <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn, of Clowance.</p>

<p>Catherine, married to John Raynwood, and secondly to
Edmund Stradling, of Dunlery.</p>

<p>Margaret, to John Godolphin, of Godolphin; and between
these his large inheritance was divided.</p>

<p>But this lordship, with many adjacent estates, came entire
to Philippa, his eldest daughter and coheir, the wife of
John Carminow, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> whose posterity lived here in great
splendour, and went by the name of the great Carminows.</p>

<p>John Carminow, of Fentongollan, was Sheriff of Cornwall
in the fifth year of Henry the Eighth. His son,
Thomas Carminow, was a gallant courtier and gentleman
of the privy chamber to the same king; but his grandson,
Oliver Carminow, put a final end to the greatness of his
family, having squandered away a vast estate, no less it is
said than eight thousand pounds a year of actual receipts,
leaving two daughters coheirs to what remained.</p>

<p>Ann, married to William Salter, of Devonshire.</p>

<p>Margaret, to Philip Cole, also of Devonshire, who sold
this lordship to one Mr. Holcomb, in the latter part of
<!--218.png--><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a><span class="pageno">212</span>
Queen Elizabeth’s reign. The Carminow family was, however,
continued through George, younger brother to Oliver,
who lived at Polmawgan, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Winnow, as his posterity
did at Trehanick, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Teath, where the last male of this
family died, in the reign of King Charles the Second.</p>

<p>Mr. Holcomb sold this place in the reign of James the
First to Sir Nicholas Hals, who resided here. His son
John Hals, parted with it to Ezekiel Grosse, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> whose
daughter carried this, together with sixteen other manors,
to the family of Buller, of Shillingham; and Francis Buller
sold it in King Charles the Second’s reign to Hugh
Boscawen, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> who pulled down this noble old mansion,
the lofty tower and fine chapel, and carried the stones to
build his new house at Tregothnan, so that not a footstep
is to be seen of this once magnificent place, and a poor
farm-house is built for a tenant in its stead.</p>

<p>Under Fentongollan is a passage or ferry boat to go
to Truro, and likewise to Kea, which is called Mopas; this
place was formerly famous for oysters, which are now
spoiled by the vessels that carry off the copper ore, which
vessels, lying generally at this place, and pumping up the
poisonous water from the ore, let in by leakage, have infected
them with a strong brassy taste, so that eating a few
of them will make any one ill; and yet, what is very remarkable,
the oysters themselves grow large and fatten as
well as ever.</p>

<p>Adjoining to Fentongollan is Treganyan, which I take
to be a contraction of Tre-gan-ythan, the fursy town on
the downs: however, its present plight may be better. This
was anciently the seat of the family of Sayer.</p>

<p>To the south of Treganyan is the church town and rectory
house, and near to them is Tregothnan, which signifies
the old town in the valley, a name suitable to the situation
of the old house, although not of the new one. This
place was anciently the seat of a family of the same name,
till Johanna, the daughter and heir of John Tregothnan,
by her marriage in the 8th year of Edward the Third,
<!--219.png--><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a><span class="pageno">213</span>
1334, with John Boscawen, of Boscawen Rose, in the parish
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Burian, brought Tregothnan to this family, whose
principal seat it hath been ever since, now just upon four
hundred years; who have greatly enriched themselves, as
well as ennobled their blood, since that time, by marriages
with the heiresses of Albalanda, Trenoweth, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> and by
matching themselves into the most eminent families of the
county.</p>

<p>By a bill indented, bearing date the 4th of July 20th of
Henry the Seventh, Thomas Hobbs, clerk, witnesseth to
have received for the king’s use, of Richard Boscawen,
<abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> five pounds of lawful money, in full of his fine to be
released from the dignity of Knight of the Bath, at the creation
of Prince Henry.</p>

<p>Sir John Arundell, of Trerice, knight, late Sheriff, acknowledges
to have received of Hugh Boscawen, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> four
marks of lawful money of England to their Majesties’ use,
for that he repaired not to the Queen’s coronation to receive
the honour of knighthood, dated January the 18th, the 1st
and <abbr title="second">2d</abbr> of Philip and Mary. This is the gentleman said
in “the Bayliff of Blackmore,” to have been a wise man,
learned in the laws of the realm, who yet was outwitted,
or rather cheated, by a family of Truro, of which he tells
a long story.</p>

<p>Hugh Boscawen, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> was Sheriff of Cornwall the 10th
of King Charles the First, and was grandson to the above
Hugh Boscawen, through his eldest surviving son Nicholas
Boscawen and Alice his wife, one of the daughters and coheirs
of John Trevanion, of Trevoster.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Mr. Hals has very naturally been induced to give the
history of this parish, particularly of Fentongollan, and
of every one connected with it, at great length; but he has
done this in a manner so diffuse and incoherent, that the
Editor has thought it expedient to omit nearly the whole,
<!--220.png--><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a><span class="pageno">214</span>
and to substitute a short abridgment made by Mr. Lysons
from Hals and Tonkin, although this will include some repetition
from the latter.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">LYSONS.</p>

<p>The manor and barton of Penkevil belonged in the reign
of Edward the First to the family of De Wen, from whom
Hals supposes it passed in marriage to the Penkevils; it
is however quite as probable that the property remained
in the same family, they assuming a new name from the
place of their abode. This family, says Hals, flourished for
several descents in a genteel degree, till the reign of Queen
Elizabeth, when Penkevil was given or sold to George
Courtenay, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> whose great-grandson alienated it to
Hender Molesworth, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> by whom it was conveyed to
Hugh Boscawen, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr></p>

<p>The manor of Fentongolland, which extends into the
parish of Merther, is said to have belonged at an early
period to a family of the same name, from whom it passed
by a succession of female heirs, to the families of Trejago
and Trenoweth. John Trenoweth, who died in 1497, left
four daughters, coheirs. The eldest, Philippa, brought
this manor to John Carminow, of Resprin, (a younger
branch of the Carminows, of Carminow,) who became, in
consequence of this match, as Mr. Hals says, “more
famous for his wealth than any other of his name or house,
or than any other family in Cornwall.” Thomas, son of
this John Carminow, was gentleman of the privy chamber
to King Henry the Eighth. Hals, speaking of the hospitality
of John Carminow, the grandson, says, “That he
kept open house for all comers and goers, drinkers, minstrels,
dancers, and what not, during Christmas time; and
that his usual allowances of provisions for these twelve days
were twelve fat bullocks, sixty statute bushels of wheat,
thirty-six sheep, with hogs, lambs, and fowls of all sorts,
and drink made of wheat and oat malt proportionable, for
<!--221.png--><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a><span class="pageno">215</span>
at that time barley malt was little known or used in those
parts.”</p>

<p>Oliver Carminow, son of this John, is said to have squandered
away the greater part of his very valuable estates.
He left two daughters, married to Salter and Cole, by
whom this manor was sold, in the year 1600, to the Holcombes.
Sir Nicholas Hals purchased this estate in 1603,
and made Fentongollan his residence; his son sold it to
Ezekiel Grosse, whose daughter and heiress brought this
and several other estates to Francis Buller, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Shillingham.
It was purchased of that family about the year
1676, by Hugh Boscawen, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who soon afterwards pulled
down the fine old mansion-house of the Carminows, with
its lofty towers and chapel. A farm-house now occupies
the site.</p>

<p>Tregothnan, the seat of Lord Viscount Falmouth, came
to the Boscawens in marriage with the heiress of Tregothnan
in the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>Treganyan, or Tregonian, formerly the seat of a family
bearing the same name, passed by successive female heirs
to the Haleps and Sayers; by bequest from the latter to
Trevelyan; and by a coheiress of Trevelyan to Rowe. It
was purchased of the Rowes by Mr. George Simmons, who
conveyed it to Lord Falmouth. The barton-house is now
occupied by a farmer.</p>

<p>Nancarrow, in this parish, was also the property of a
family to whom it gave its name.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The family of Boscawen is unquestionably of very great
antiquity, of Norman or British origin, having either imparted
their name to Boscawen Rose, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Burian, or
received it from that place.</p>

<p>The peninsula west of the Mount’s Bay, little frequented
in former ages, and scarcely accessible to strangers,
abounded, as all similar districts have been found to do,
with long settled possessors of landed property; who, content
with the small fortunes transmitted from their ancestors,
<!--222.png--><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a><span class="pageno">216</span>
lived on in succession the protectors, the benefactors,
and the paternal governors of their neighbourhoods.  Such
were the Boscawens, Vyvyans, Levelas, Trevilians, Noyes,
and perhaps Usticks, Davieses, Kegwins, and some others,
all inhabitants for centuries of this remote portion of Cornwall,
and all arranged on similar scales of property and
influence. The Boscawens however emerged in the fourteenth
century, and pursued with great perseverance and
success the only path then leading to advancement in the
world. They married heiress after heiress, and acquired
extensive properties in various parts of the county.</p>

<p>The Boscawens were among the few Cornish gentlemen
in the western division, who took what may now be called
the liberal side in the Civil War, and they continued
to oppose the arbitrary principles of the faction, having
at its head the two last brothers of the house of Stuart&mdash;and
assisted in the glorious Revolution which secured us
from civil and religious despotism, by placing the Prince
of Orange on our vacant throne.</p>

<p>Hugh Boscawen married Margaret Clinton, eventually
coheiress of the Earl of Lincoln, by whom he had a numerous
family, all of whom died before him, with the exception
of Bridget, married to Hugh Fortescue, ancestor
of Earl Fortescue; and with this lady, Mr. Hals states that
Mr. Boscawen gave lands and money to the value of a
hundred thousand pounds; he died in 1701, and was succeeded
by his relation of the same name. This gentleman
is understood to have possessed very considerable talents,
and powers of exerting them. He continued ably to support
the Revolution government, and brought to it a powerful
aid arising from the peculiar feature which distinguished
Cornwall up to the year 1832.</p>

<p>In 1714, on the German accession, hopes, fears, expectation,
and party violence, burst forth with all the fury that
had driven them into action thirty years before. Vigorous
proceedings were therefore demanded, and may be justified
by the exhortation at Salamis, Νυν ὑπερ παντων Αγων.
<!--223.png--><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a><span class="pageno">217</span>
Yet in moments of cool reflection, and at the distance of
a hundred and twenty years from this agitated period,
one cannot refrain from thinking that Mr. Boscawen was
carried beyond the limits of duty to his country, or zeal for
his associates embarked in the same cause, when he undertook
and executed the task of arresting his countrymen,
and probably his former friends, on the suspicion of their
entertaining opinions more favourable than his own to
monarchical power, and to what in modern phrase might
perhaps be termed conservative principles.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Vyvyan was seized at Trelowarren, conveyed
by water to Pendennis Castle, and from thence to the
Tower. Mr. Basset, of Tehidy, would also have been
arrested if he had not left his house; and other proceedings
were taken of equal violence.</p>

<p>These acts, however necessary at the time, produced
their moral effects of creating feuds and permanent irritations,
so that while the principal agent was admired by one
party, and received the reward of an hereditary seat in
parliament, as was industriously propagated, in return for
these services, the opposite party detested his name, and
usually joined to it an epithet drawn from the inferior
apparitors of the common law.</p>

<p>This gentleman, created Viscount Falmouth in 1720,
married Charlotte, daughter and coheir of Charles Godfrey,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> and his wife Charlotte Churchill, sister of the
great Duke of Marlborough. They had a very numerous
family; the eldest son, Hugh Boscawen, succeeded of
course to his father’s estate and hereditary seat in parliament;
very little is remembered about him. He is believed
to have been kind and benevolent in private life,
and the Editor is anxious to avail himself of this opportunity
for acknowledging an act of generous and feeling
liberality exercised by this gentleman to the benefit of a
near relation, about fourscore years ago. In ability he
probably fell much below the usual standard of his family,
for he is known to have been cajoled into marrying a kept
mistress; and idle tales are circulated of his mistaking
<!--224.png--><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><span class="pageno">218</span>
“Optat ephippia Bos” for the Latin of his own name, and
Horace Walpole for the Roman poet. It is probable these
mistakes never literally happened, but such anecdotes are
usually characteristic of the individual; if however they
really were made, the credit of the family has been amply
redeemed by a nephew, who has given to the public one of
the best translations of Horace extant in any language.</p>

<p>Of his various brothers very little also is known or remembered,
excepting of one, and that one is Admiral Boscawen,
the glory not of Cornwall but of his country, the
Nelson of his time.</p>

<p>Edward Boscawen went early to sea, expecting (as the
Editor has heard from one to whom he related the circumstances)
to be advanced almost immediately through family
interest and connection to the station of a Lieutenant;
when the order was suddenly made for subjecting all midshipmen
to a service of six years at the least. “To this
order,” he was accustomed to say, “I owe all my knowledge
of seamanship, and to this order the British Fleet is mainly
indebted for the superior knowledge and skill of its officers.”</p>

<p>The young man was properly advanced as occasions
offered themselves; and from the period of his commanding
a ship, his whole career was one of glory and of deserved
success. Besides engagements with single ships, and their
capture, his achievements are recorded at Porto Bello,
Carthagena, Cape Finisterre, the East Indies, the Coast
of Spain, and above all at Louisbourgh Harbour, in Cape
Breton, where he effected a conquest most gallant in itself,
and essential to the subjugation of Canada by General
Wolfe; and what may equal the spolia opima of Rome, he
three times made M. Hoquart, the French commander, a
prisoner in the course of one war.</p>

<p>Admiral Boscawen was beloved throughout the navy for
his care and attention to the health, the comfort, and the
happiness of every one under his command, to as high a
degree as he was admired for skill, for prudence, and for
valour; throughout Cornwall he was adored. So that, notwithstanding
the rule observed in that county, of considering
<!--225.png--><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a><span class="pageno">219</span>
every gentleman who obtains a seat in the Upper House
of Parliament, as relinquishing for himself of course, and
also for his family, in favour of other gentlemen, all claim
to the county representation, Admiral Boscawen, standing
completely on his own personal merits, and founding a
new branch from an ancient family, was invited to accept
the situation of member for Cornwall. The general election
arising from the accession of George the Third was
approaching, when a fever closed the life of this great man,
on the 10th of January 1761, in the 50th year of his age.</p>

<p>Admiral Boscawen married Frances, daughter of William
Evelyn Glanville, a lady possessed of every quality
that could adorn the highest station, or that could render
her amiable in domestic life.</p>

<p>They had several children:</p>

<p>The eldest, called after his father’s name, died at Spa in
Germany, in early life, on the 17th of July 1774.</p>

<p>The second son, William Glanville Boscawen, having
engaged in the sea service, anxious to emulate the splendid
example given by his father, and having become a Lieutenant,
was most unfortunately drowned in Jamaica, on the
21st of April 1769. On this melancholy occasion the following
elegy was composed by Doctor John Walcot.</p>

<p>This gentleman was bred to the medical profession under
an uncle at Fowey, where he afterwards practised,
but standing high in the estimation of Sir William Trelawny,
appointed Governor of Jamaica, Doctor Walcot,
provided with a medical degree, went out with him as his
physician; and in times when propriety and decorum were
less attended to than at present, he was also admitted into
holy orders, and thus became qualified for holding a living in
the Island, one of which he actually obtained; but having
returned to England after the Governor’s decease, he relinquished
the preferment, which could not be held without
residence, and abandoned the character of a clergyman.</p>

member for Corfe Castle, and for the county of Dorset; they
have an only son, who with the double portion of honour
that invests young men who apply themselves to learning
or science, without the ordinary stimuli of pecuniary benefit,
or of advancement in the world, obtained the high distinction
at Oxford in 1832 of being included in the first
class of literary merit.</p>

<p>Tregothnan, from its bold and elevated situation, commanding
an extensive view, intersected by various branches
of the Falmouth river, and of the harbour, from the abundance
of its trees and woods, and from the integrity of its
surrounding property fenced in by natural boundaries,
must be considered as the first gentleman’s seat in Cornwall,
with the exception perhaps of Mount Edgcumbe.
The house standing there till within these few years, bore
the appearance of considerable antiquity, and harmonized
with the surrounding scenery; the ruins of Fentongollan
could not have been used for building this house, as
Mr. Hals relates: they may have supplied materials for
repair, or for additional offices.</p>

<p>The present proprietor has taken down the old house,
and replaced it by a new one, that may compete with the
best in England for real utility, and for decorations harmonizing
with its bold situation and surrounding landscape.</p>

<p>The old parish church, and its massive tower, supported
by immense buttresses, form altogether a venerable and
impressive group, visible for a great distance in almost
every direction. The advowson of the living was acquired
with Fentongollan.</p>

<p>This parish measures 961 statute acres.</p>

<p>There is little deserving of remark in this parish, except
some doubtful remains of military antiquities. Mr. Lysons
says, that the great duchy manor of Helston in Trig,
extends over the greater part of this parish, and that what
was formerly called Helsbury Park, is possessed by the
Duke of Bedford, under a lease; and that just without the
former boundary of the park are extensive earthworks,
which Mr. Lysons conjectures to be the spot described as
a castle by William of Worcester, and probably of great
antiquity. The church has a few monuments to the Lowers
and others. The only village in this parish, in addition to
the church town, is called Treveighan.</p>

<p>Trevenin was a seat of some branch of the Lower family,
now all extinct; and Tregone, heretofore belonging to the
Mayows, is now the property of Mr. Hockin.</p>

<p>The advowson is in the Duke of Cornwall. Mr. Tonkin
says in the Crown; but much confusion seems to have existed
in former times between the claims of these two corporations
sole, and if such a subject were worthy of investigation,
it is probable that many inaccuracies might
still be discovered.</p>

<p>I shall begin with the barton of Carclew. I find the
name of this place anciently written Crucglew. Cruc is a
barrow, and also clew I apprehend to be an inclosure; so
that the whole signifies the inclosure of barrows, or by
barrows, of which there are several in the adjoining commons.
The first owner of this place that I can meet with
is Dangeros, or Dangers, who married Margery, the
<!--231.png--><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a><span class="pageno">225</span>
daughter of Bartholomew Serischall, whose arms were the
same with the Seriseaux: Argent, a saltire Sable, between
twelve cherries slipped Proper; in the reign I believe of
Henry the Second.</p>

<p>Robert de Cardinan, by a very ancient deed, without
date, which I have seen, gave Crucgleu and Pengaer to
Richard Dangeros and his heirs.</p>

<p>This family, who by their matches seem to have been
gentlemen of considerable note, continued at this place till
the beginning of the reign of Henry the Fourth, when
James Dangero left two daughters and coheirs:</p>

<p>Margaret, married to David Renaudin, of Arwothal; and
Isabella, married to Richard Bonithon, second son of Simon
Bonithon, of Bonithon.</p>

<p>This barton fell to the share of the said David Renaudin,
but he and Margaret his wife dying without issue, their
portion of the whole inheritance, said to be worth £500
per annum, came to Richard Bonithon and Isabella his
wife. The last male descendant of this family, Richard
Bonithon, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> a very worthy gentleman, died July the
31st 1697, in the 45th year of his age, leaving by Honor
his wife, daughter of Sir Thomas Heale, of Fleet, one
daughter and heir, Jane, married to Samuel Kempe, of
Penryn, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>; which said Samuel Kempe died without
issue, October the 20th 1728, leaving the said barton of
Carclew, and some small part of the ancient lands, (for he
had sold off the rest in his lifetime,) to his widow, who
now resideth there; a lady who, for her many virtues,
bounty, and other accomplishments, deserveth a much
better fortune, in every respect, than she has had the luck
to meet with.</p>

<p>The said Mr. Kempe built a noble house here, which
he did not live to finish, and had laid such a plan for
avenues, gardens, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> as when brought to perfection would
have made it one of the pleasantest seats in the county.</p>

<p>There hath been much tin on this barton, and perhaps it
would turn to good account if a deep adit were brought in to
<!--232.png--><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a><span class="pageno">226</span>
unwater the shafts in depth. There is also a pretty good
lode of antimony not wrought, and perhaps not worth
working.</p>

<p>The arms of D’Angers, or Dangeros, as they were painted
in the old glass windows at Carclew, were Sable, a chevron
between three flowers-de-luce Argent.</p>

<p>Arms of Bonython: Argent, a chevron between three
flowers-de-luce Sable. But they likewise gave them, as
appear in the old hall, as above, with three pelicans feeding
their young ones in the nests, Argent, added.</p>

<p class="p2 center smaller">THE MANOR OF RESTRONGET.</p>

<p>This manor joins with Carclew. It was formerly written
Restrongas, and I take the sense of the word to be Res,
Ros, Rose, a valley; trong, a nose, used in the same sense
as we use ness, from the French, for land jutting into the
sea; and gas, or guys, deep; so as to signify altogether, the
valley with the deep promontory or point of land. William
de Bodrigan was lord of this manor in the 12th of
Henry the Fourth. And that family possessed it till the
beginning of the reign of Henry the Seventh, when, on
the attainder of Bodrigan, it was given to William Trevanion,
in which family it still continues, John Trevanion, of
Carhayes, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> being the present lord thereof. In the village
of Restronget have lived in lease for several generations
a younger branch of the Leys of Ponacumb.</p>

<p>There is a passing boat kept here, it being the post
road, and by much the nearest cut from Falmouth to
Truro and the east, called Restronget Passage.</p>

<p>A part of the Bishop’s manor of Penryn extends into
this parish.</p>

<p class="p2 center smaller">MANOR OF TREFUSIS AND TREGOSE.</p>

<p>Trefusis, saith the Editor of Camden, in the Additional
Part, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 22, signifies a walled town, or fortified place.
<!--233.png--><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a><span class="pageno">227</span>
This hath been the seat of an eminent family of the same
name ever since the Conquest, if not before. The present
possessor hereof is Robert Trefusis, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> a young gentleman
of great hopes, who is yet unmarried. These gentlemen,
led away by a false notion, (with many others) of
being of French extraction, have given, in allusion to the
supposed meaning of their name in the language of that
country, for their arms, Argent, a chevron between three
fusees, or wharrow spindles, Sable.</p>

<p>The house is extremely pleasant by its situation, and
would be much more so were it built a little higher up.
To the south of the house is a fine grove, and a walk, at
the end of which is a pleasure-house, built by this gentleman’s
father, from whence there is a very beautiful prospect.</p>

<p>Adjoining to Trefusis is Nankersy, that is the winding
valley, from ceirsie, to twist or wind about. This place,
by a lease from the Trefusises, has been for two or three
generations the seat of a younger branch of the Littletons,
of Lanhidrock; the late owner, William Littleton, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr>
died a bachelor in the year 1734, and by his decease the
estate is fallen into the lord’s hands. The arms of Littleton
are Argent, a chevron between three escallops Sable.</p>

<p>On this Nankersy hath been lately built by the Dutchmen
a considerable town, called by them Flushing, after a
town of the same name in Zealand, by which name it is
now generally known. And had these Dutchmen had the
continuing of this town, they would have made it in some
measure to resemble its namesake, by digging a canal to
discharge all sorts of merchandise through the middle of
it, there being a large marsh adjoining, that seemed by
nature to have been placed for that purpose; but as it is,
though there are some good houses here, the whole is
without any order, contrivance, or regularity. The late
Samuel Trefusis, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> was at no small expense in levelling
the place, the buildings, quays, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> for loading or unloading
the vessels; and could he have settled the packet boats
<!--234.png--><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a><span class="pageno">228</span>
here, for which it lies far better than Falmouth, the water
being deeper, and they all lying before it, Flushing would
soon have been a place of great resort; but, having failed in
that, the town is now falling to decay, and many of the
houses of which it consists are uninhabited.</p>

<p class="p2 center smaller">THE MANOR OF MYLOR.</p>

<p>A small lordship which takes its name from the parish,
and in which the church is situated, so that probably the
churchyard and the glebe were taken out of it by the gift
of some former proprietor, although the fact is now forgotten.
The present lord of this manor is Martin Lister
Killigrew, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> an adopted heir to Sir Peter Killigrew.</p>

<p>The church is situated at the south-east end of the parish,
near that branch of Falmouth haven called Mylor pool.
It is but a small building, consisting of a nave, one aisle of
the same length, with a handsome north cross aisle, belonging
to Carclew; and a little distance from the west is
a low square campanile covered with slate, in which are
three bells.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Mr. Tonkin seems to have fallen into an error respecting
the valuation of this living in the taxation of Pope Nicholas;
which he says was £6. 8<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 4<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> But no name in
the least degree resembling Milor, can be found under
Kerrier hundred in the parliamentary publication of that
record, nor is any parish rated at that sum.</p>

<p>The church contains several monuments. The most interesting
is one of marble, placed there to the memory of
her father, mother, and husband, by Jane, the heiress of
the Bonithon family, and widow of Samuel Kempe, who
built the house at Carclew, and died on the 20th of October
1728, in the 59th year of his age.</p>

<p>There is also a monument to Francis Trefusis, who died
in 1680, decorated by handsome sculpture. And one to
<!--235.png--><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a><span class="pageno">229</span>
the memory of Edward Baynton Yescombe, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> who fell
while he was bravely defending the King George, Lisbon
packet, against the enemy, in August 1803. And another
executed by the celebrated artist Mr. Westmacott, to the
memory of Reginald Cocks, youngest son of Charles Cocks,
Lord Somers, and Anne his wife, sister of the late Mr. Reginald
Pole Carew.</p>

<p>Carclew was devised by Jane Kempe to her relation Mr.
James Bonithon, of Grampound, from whom it was purchased
by Mr. Lemon in 1749, who immediately began to
finish the house, and to complete the whole as a family
residence on the scale appropriate to every thing that he
undertook. Here Mrs. Lemon resided after she became a
widow, and here the family have resided ever since. Mr.
and Mrs. Lemon had an only son William Lemon, who
married Anne, daughter of Mr. John Willyams, of Carnanton.
Both died in early life, leaving three children.</p>

<p>William, born <abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr> 6, 1748, who succeeded his grandfather
in 1760, married Jane, daughter of James Buller, of
Morvall, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> was elected member of Penryn, on the decease
of Mr. Francis Basset in 1769, and at the general election
of 1774 succeeded in a contest to represent the county,
which, universally esteemed and respected, he continued
to do by ten subsequent unanimous elections, during a
period of fifty years, up to his decease on the 11th of December
1824. This gentleman was created a Baronet, and
commanded for several years the county militia.</p>

<p>John, the second son, became a colonel in the army,
commanded the militia of Cornish Miners, served in parliament
for the borough of Saltash, and four times for
Truro. He died unmarried in 1814, at Polvellan, a place
that he had created with great taste on the southern side of
the lake, loch, or loo, formed by the two rivers above East
and West Looe, and close on the margin of a large salt
water pond, made to retain the sea water at high tide, afterwards
to give motion to the machinery of grist mills,
<!--236.png--><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a><span class="pageno">230</span>
from whence Mr. Lemon named his new place Pol-Vellan,
in Cornish the mill-pool.</p>

<p>Colonel Lemon was such a proficient in music as to
perform extemporaneous voluntaries; and several psalm
tunes and chants of his composition have been printed.</p>

<p>Anna Lemon, the sister, married Mr. John Buller, of
Morval.</p>

<p>Sir William Lemon greatly improved Carclew, and
added most materially to the extent of the property round
his seat, by purchasing from Mr. Trefusis the manor of
Restronget, which had been acquired some years before
from Mr. Trevanion.</p>

<p>He is most worthily succeeded by his son Sir Charles
Lemon, now member for the county, to whom the house
at Carclew is indebted for still further improvements made
in the best taste; the grounds and gardens have also been
enlarged and beautified, and further arrangements and other
decorations are still in progress. It is a very curious circumstance
that several acres of ground at Carclew have
been recently found covered with the <a name="err_11" id="err_11"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eria ciliaris</i>, not
known before as an English plant.</p>

<p>Of his eight sisters three have married Cornish gentlemen.
Harriet, married to the late Lord de Dunstanville.
Caroline, to John Heale Tremayne, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> late
member for the county. Jane, to her double cousin-german
Mr. Anthony Buller, Barrister-at-law, and knighted
on his going to India as a judge.</p>

<p>The family of Trefusis can now scarcely be considered
as connected with Cornwall, Robert George William
Trefusis having succeeded, on the death of George Walpole,
Earl of Orford, to the barony in fee of Clinton, created
by writ of summons in the year 1299, the 28th of
Edward the First, and under a deed of settlement, made
by the same Lord Orford, having succeeded also to a very
large estate, chiefly in Devonshire; and finally, in consequence
of their having alienated by far the greater part
of their possessions in this county.</p>

<p><!--237.png--><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a><span class="pageno">231</span>
This gentleman having married Marianne Gaulis, a lady
of Switzerland, and died in 1797, has been succeeded by
his son Robert Cotton <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John Trefusis. He married
one of the daughters of William Stephen Poyntz, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
and niece of Mark Anthony Browne, last Lord Montague,
of Cowdray Castle, in Sussex; but having died without
issue, he is succeeded by his brother Charles Trefusis.
The widow is recently married again to Colonel Horace
Seymour.</p>

<p>The situation of Trefusis is very beautiful, the whole
jutting into Falmouth harbour, with Penryn river on the
south and Milor river to the north.</p>

<p>Mr. Tonkin has given a picture of Flushing, very far
from corresponding with its present features: instead of
falling into decay it has grown up to be an elegant town,
although the packet station has not been fixed there, nor
is it in all probability suited to that purpose.</p>

<p>If the word Gas, or Guys, which Mr. Tonkin says
means deep in Cornish, should also, as in some other languages,
bear the correlative sense of lofty, his explanation
of Restronget would be more complete.</p>

<p>Near the church are some ruins still to be seen of a monastic
establishment, said by Mr. Lysons, on the authority
of Doctor William Borlase’s manuscript collections, to
have been a priory of Black Monks called Minster, or Tolcarne,
founded by William de Botreaux, as a cell to Tywardreth,
itself subject to the abbey of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Sergius and
Bacchus, in Angiers. Tywardreth, however, after having
been seized into the King’s hands, as an alien priory, was
made independent and denizen, and continued till the
general dissolution by Henry the Eighth. Probably therefore
Minster remained as a parcel of Tywardreth up to the
same eventful period.</p>

<p>Tanner, however, calls it merely an alien priory to the
abbey of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Sergius and Bacchus at Angiers, without any
notice of Tywardreth.</p>

<p>In Dugdale’s Monasticon is the following addition to
<!--239.png--><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a><span class="pageno">233</span>
Tanner: Minster Prior, alienigena habet in proprios usus
Ecclesias de Minster et Bodecastell; and in a note there
is a reference to muniments in Exeter Cathedral, and to
MS. collections in the British Museum, <abbr title="volume forty page">vol. XL. p.</abbr> 39,
for a resignation of this priory by the abbot and convent
de Valle, or Vale Royal, in Cheshire; from which it would
seem that this house was not restored to Tywardreth after
the sequestration of both.</p>

<p>The manor of Pollifont, in Lewannick, (see that parish)
which formerly belonged to this priory, is now an appendage
to the living, so that the rector of Minster is lord of
the manor of Pollifont; and the customs of the manor are
said to be, that on the accession of a new rector, after the
decease of the former, but not otherwise, the tenants pay
him thirty pounds and one penny, raised according to some
ancient schedule among themselves.</p>

<p>Several small fees are due on surrenders and on admissions
at the manor courts, and on the death of each tenant
a heriot becomes due to the lord, which is either his best
beast or six guineas, and in addition to these, there is an
annual payment of four pounds.</p>

<p>Minster church lies in a deep valley, surrounded by
trees, giving the strongest impression of its forming the
quire of a sequestered monastery. It contains several monuments
to the Henders, Cottons, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> One has a Latin
inscription, with the curious pedantic device of certain letters
standing prominent among others in the different
words, and indicating, as Roman numerals, the various
dates. Four lines on William Cotton, son of William
Cotton who held the see of Exeter from 1598 to 1621, and
on Elizabeth his wife, daughter and coheir of John Hender,
have been frequently transcribed, on account of their extreme
simplicity:</p>

<div class="poem">

This church is one of the very few in Cornwall that
want the decoration of a tower, and strange legends are
circulated to account for this defect, probably of a more
ancient date than the Reformation. The bells are said to
have arrived in a vessel almost to the spot where they would
have been landed, when an expression of the captain, implying
confidence in the powers which God had given him,
construed into blasphemy by Anthopomophites of all religions,
is supposed to have caused the immediate destruction
of the ship, with every one on board; but when the
ground seas roll with their accustomed violence on this
iron-bound coast, the bells are still fancied not only to
ring a peal, but to indicate by particular sounds the cause
of this reputed miracle, intended to convince mankind
that they are bound to neglect and to render vain whatever
gifts the Almighty may have bestowed on them, and
thanklessly to employ their time in imploring more.</p>

<p>This place was in feudal times the residence of a baronial
family, bearing the name of Botreaux, which they imparted
to a manor, or, as the Court Rolls would testify, to
an honor, having manors dependent, and enclosing the
town of Botreaux Castle, dignified by the appellation of
a borough; a term, it may be observed, that had not in
ancient times any reference to the privilege of sending
members to parliament.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons says, that William Lord Botreaux, the last
of this family, fell in the second battle of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Alban’s, leaving
an only daughter, married to Sir Robert Hungerford.</p>

<p>The honour of Botreaux, and the manor of Worthyvale,
went with the heiress of Hungerford to the family of Hastings,
by whom this property was sold to John Hender,
<abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> in the reign of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>John Hender appears to have had four daughters and
coheiresses: Katharine, married to John Molesworth;
Frances, to Richard Robarts, of Truro; Mary, to Ellis
Heale, of Devonshire; and Elizabeth, to William Cotton,
son of the Bishop; Boscastle and Worthyvale came as a
portion to the last.</p>

<p><!--241.png--><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a><span class="pageno">235</span>
Sir John Cotton, probably the grandson of William
Cotton, resided here, and died in 1703, without a family;
he gave the property to his sister’s son, Mr. Amy, Sheriff
of Cornwall in the year 1714, whose father had the living
of Minster. His son, Cotton Amy, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> married one of
the two daughters and coheiresses of Samuel Gilbert, of
Tackbear, in Bridgerule, and had two daughters: Grace,
married to Mr. Jonathan Phillipps, of Camelford, a Captain
in the Cornwall Militia. This lady had several children,
who all died at early ages; and her sister never married,
having continued in a state of derangement at Botreaux
Castle for many years.</p>

<p>Sir Jonathan Phillipps (for he had been knighted on the
occasion of presenting an address from Camelford, when a
female offering a petition to King George the Third, was
observed to have a knife in her hand,) left his share of
this property, with the remainder of his own estate, to
Mr. Thomas Winslow, the <a name="chg_5" id="chg_5"></a>son of his sister, on his
taking the name of Phillipps, which he did, and was succeeded
by his son, who now resides at Landue, in Lezant,
but having purchased that place and lands about it, Mr.
Phillipps has parted with much of the estate at Botreaux
Castle to Mr. Avery, a gentleman who carries on a very
considerable trade there, and seems likely to raise the
place into greater opulence and importance than it can
have experienced since the fall of its feudal grandeur.</p>

<p>An elevated piece of ground, rendered steep by artificial
scarping, is pointed out as the site of the castle, which gave
a termination to the honour of Botreaux. This castle had,
however, disappeared before the time of Carew; and the
dwelling of Sir John Cotton, probably constructed after
the castle had become a ruin, which used to be called <span class="title">The
Great House</span>, was scarcely habitable fifty years ago, and
has now disappeared.</p>

<p>The port of Botreaux Castle admits coasting vessels in
fine weather, and considerable trade is carried on there by
exporting the excellent slatestone with which that neighbourhood
abounds, and by importing coal and lime, in addition
<!--242.png--><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a><span class="pageno">236</span>
to such articles of commerce as the adjacent country
may require.</p>

<p>It is generally believed that the harbour might be rendered
safe and commodious for a sum much within the
limits of private expenditure. Ponderous articles might be
raised to any required level by the power of water wheels,
and from the summit of the acclivity, a flat plain extends
to the distance of many miles inland; so that a possibility
at the least seems to exist, of Botreaux Castle becoming
the site of an extensive commerce.</p>

<p>The advowson of the living belongs jointly to Mr.
Thomas John Phillipps, representative through his great
uncle of Miss Grace Amy, and the representatives of her
sister. The late incumbent was the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> R. Winsloe, uncle
to Mr. Phillipps.</p>

<p>The manor of Worthyvale was sold to Mr. Hugh Boscawen
in the early part of the last century, and was used
as a hunting seat; it has again been sold by one of his
descendants, and it belonged some years since to a gentleman
of the name of Farnham.</p>

<p>The single stone laid over a stream, having some letters
cut on its lower surface, and which is believed to have
marked the exact spot where Arthur received his death wound,
is nearly in front of the house at Worthyvale.</p>

<p>This parish measures 2838 statute acres.</p>

<p>The manor of Bodmin was bestowed by the King on the
well-known poet Mr. Thomas Sternhold, for his translation
of The Psalms, which may fairly be considered as a
very adequate reward; but almost all the ecclesiastical possessions
were given to the Prideauxes, and were finally
sold about fifty years ago, soon after the decease of the
last representative of the Devonshire branch of that family.
Both the appropriated rectory and the vicarage were
purchased by the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William Sandys.</p>

<p><!--245.png--><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a><span class="pageno">239</span>
Mr. Sandys distinguished himself at Oxford, and was in
consequence elected a Fellow of All Souls. He travelled
through the south of Europe with Mr. Francis Basset, afterwards
Lord de Dunstanville, and held the living of Illogan
till Mr. John Basset, a younger brother, received
priest’s orders. He married Miss Mary Praed, of Trevethow;
and dying in 1816, he left the larger part of a
handsome fortune to Mr. William Warren, a sister’s son,
who married Miss Marshall, another sister’s daughter, and
their son having taken the name of Sandys, is now the
possessor, and resides at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Minver.</p>

<p>A presentation to the vicarage was given by Mr. Sandys
to the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> George Treweeke, the son of a third sister,
who has also the rectory of Illogan.</p>

<p>Mr. Sandys, in consequence of some incident or of some
allusion now forgotten, but not in diminution of the respect
most justly due to his talents and his learning, acquired
the appellation of Cardinal, perhaps from his having worn
a scarlet dress at Rome, on some public occasion.</p>

<p>A monument is placed in the church to Mrs. Sandys,
with the following inscription:</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons says that the manor of Penmear was given
by the Black Prince to Sir William Woodland, usher of
his chamber, but that it reverted again to the Duchy.</p>

<p>Trevernon, or Trewornan, belonged in the reign of king
James the First, to Thomas Clifford, <abbr title="Doctor of Divinity">D.D.</abbr> It afterwards
became the seat of the Howes; from whom it passed, with
<!--246.png--><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a><span class="pageno">240</span>
an heiress, to the Darells. It is now the residence of the
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Darell Stephens, their representative.</p>

<p>There is a monument to Thomas Darell, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> who died

<p>Pentire Point in this parish is the boldest promontory
on the southern side of the Bristol Channel. The barton of
which this headland forms a part, belonged to a family of
the same name, till it passed with an heiress to Roscarrock,
and from them by an heiress to Tremayne; and
it belongs at present to John Hearle Tremayne, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> of
Heligon.</p>

<p>Trevelver, once a seat of the Arundells, belongs now to
the family of Yeo.</p>

<p>This parish is divided on the eastern side from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kew,
by an estuary dangerous to passengers, and where lives
were not unfrequently lost, till Mr. Sandys took the lead
in constructing a bridge across the ford, which he effected
after much exertion, and at a considerable expense to
himself.</p>

<p>Although <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Minver is strictly one entire parish, yet
there are two ancient chapels still remaining with districts
assigned to them, out of which some of the parish officers
are annually chosen.</p>

<p>The parish church, with its more appropriate division, is
called Highlands, and the remaining part annexed in some
degree to the chapels, is called Lowlands, subdivided into
north and south. One of the chapels, according to Mr.
Lysons, is dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael; which, if the fact is so,
must be a very unusual circumstance, as the wings of the
archangel appear to have associated his habits, in popular
opinion, with those of birds, which led him to delight in
elevated situations; the other chapel has for its patron <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Enodoc or <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gwinnodock.</p>

<p>One of these chapels happening to require repair about
the middle of the last century, the vestry or the parish
officers sold the bells to reimburse the expense, notwithstanding
their being tenfold consecrated by the inscription:</p>

<p class="p2 center">ALFREDUS REX.<!--247.png--><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a><span class="pageno">241</span></p>

<p class="p2">It is perhaps too much to assume that they were given
by the Great Alfred, although his visits to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neot must
have brought that most illustrious of our kings into this
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The baptising of bells, and their dedication, have so
much prevailed, that these were in all probability cast long

<p class="p2 center small">HALS.</p>

<p>The manuscript relating to this parish is lost.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>Morva is situated in the hundred of Penwith, and is
bounded to the west by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just, to the north by the sea, to
the east by Zennor, to the south by Sancred and Maddern.
It is a daughter church to Madderne, the vicar of
which performs divine service, and preacheth in the morning
on the first Sunday in every month. The said vicar
hath the small tithes.</p>

<p>Morva signifies Locus Maritimus, a place near the sea,
as this parish is. The name is sometimes written Morveth,
implying much the same sense.</p>

<p>The chief place, and almost the only one of note in this
little parish, is Tregamynyon, that is, the stony dwelling,
which was for several generations in the family of Lanyon,
and the residence of a younger branch thereof ever since
the 30th of Queen Elizabeth; for in Trinity term the 31st
year of her reign was a fine passed at Westminster between
William Lanyon, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> and Richard Lanyon, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>
and John Lanyon, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> of three messuages, ten acres of
meadow, sixty acres of pasture, one hundred and fifty
acres of furze, one water-mill, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> in Tregamynyon. Here
his posterity flourished in good repute till the reign of
Queen Anne, when John Lanyon, of this place, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> and
John Lanyon, jun. his son and heir, joined in the sale of
this estate to John Borlase, of Pendeen, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> who is the
present possessor thereof. The said John Lanyon, jun.
married to his wife Frances Brydges, sister to James Lord
Chandos, and aunt to the Duke of that name, who is since
<!--249.png--><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a><span class="pageno">243</span>
dead without issue, being well stricken in years when he
married, and twice a widower before. John Lanyon, the
father, married &mdash;&mdash; Borlase, of Pendeen. His grandfather
was commonly called the Golden Lanyon, as having
gotten great riches by tin, which he divided among his
numerous issue; but before I quit this place I must relate
for the benefit of my readers what Mr. Lanyon, sen. told
me respecting the covering of his house, as it may be of
great use to persons building in high and exposed places.
That not being able to keep his house here in good repair,
it being rifled and uncovered by every storm, he at last
resolved to plaster it with lime and hair on the lathes
within, where the stones are fastened; after which he had
not the least stripping of his healing for thirty years. This
same thing was tried with the same success by Mr. Hector
Trelevant, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes; and it is, I verily believe, a certain
and cheap prevention of damage.</p>

<p class="p2 center smaller">THE MANOR OF CARVOLGHE, OR CORVAEGHE.</p>

<p>This manor was one of those forfeited by Francis Tregian,
<abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> (See <a href="#Page_354">Probus</a>).</p>

<p>It appears by an inquisition taken in the fifth year of
King Charles the First, that the manor then belonged to
Ezekiel Grosse, of Comborne, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr></p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The church of this parish has been recently new built
with the assistance of the parliamentary grant. Its situation
near the sea adds much probability to Mr. Tonkin’s
interpretation of the name. The great tithes are appended
to those of Maddern, and belonged to the family of Nichols,
now Le Grice.</p>

<p>This parish has to boast of an ancient military work,
more curious perhaps than any other in the west of England.
It consists of two inclosures nearly circular; the
inner 174 feet in diameter, the inner wall 12 feet thick, and
<!--250.png--><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a><span class="pageno">244</span>
still remaining from 10 to 12 feet high; outside this is a
vacant space 30 feet wide, and then the second wall, having
a diameter of almost 230 feet, and built like the other,
but less solid and not so high. The stones are all laid
after the Cyclopian manner, unhewn and without cement;
yet, by great labour and repeated trials, so adjusted as to
form a close, even, and apparently smooth front. All
round the interior surface of the inner wall are traces of
rooms resembling in their situation modern casemates, and
near it appear the simple remains of an ancient town. A
description and plan of this most interesting ruin called
Castle Chiowne, or Chioune, contracted into Choon, which
is well known to mean the house in a croft, have been given
by Doctor Borlase, in his Antiquities, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 346 of the <abbr title="second">2d</abbr>
edition. There is also a description by Mr. Britton in the
second volume of the Beauties of England and Wales;
and a very accurate plan and section, with a full description,
may be found in the Archæologia published in 1829,
volume the 22d, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 300, by William Cotton, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> M.A.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that the proprietors of the soil will
take care to prevent any further destruction of this most
ancient and curious fortress, by effectually prohibiting a
practice which has disfigured even Rome itself, that of recklessly
removing the materials for domestic purposes.</p>

<p>At about 500 yards to the south-west of the Castle, is a
cromleigh noticed by Doctor Borlase, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 232.</p>

<p>Morva also contains, either in the whole or in part,
the most romantic granite hill of the western formation.
Carn Galva is entirely covered with blocks of the largest
size; and being deep in the granite district, they have
escaped that destruction of natural grandeur which inevitably
accompany the useful or beautifying improvements
effected by the hands of men.</p>

<p>Morva measures 1060 statute acres.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">HALS.</p>

<p>The manuscript relating to this parish is lost.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>Morval lies in the hundred of West, and has to the westward
the rivers Looe and Duloe, to the north <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kayne
and Leskeard, to the east <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German’s, and to the south
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s.</p>

<p>In the year 1291, the 20th of Edward the First, (if, at
least, I am right in taking this to be the church there called
Capella de Lamana,) it was valued at £1. 10<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> being then
appropriated to the Priory of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German’s.</p>

<p>Morval, a vicarage, stands in the King’s Book at
£6. 14<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 9<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span></p>

<p>The name of this parish signifies the Sea Valley, it
being written anciently Morevale; not that I would from
thence insinuate that the sea came up formerly to this
place, though the same be not impossible. But as Morval
may be interpreted the Mory or Fenny Valley, I rather
take that to be the right.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.
<!--252.png--><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a><span class="pageno">246</span></p>

<p>It is with much diffidence that I venture to approach the
subject of etymologies, but it seems at least to be clear that
Mr. Tonkin is mistaken. Val or Vale is not Cornish for a
valley, but an inclosure. More, in its original signification
is great, large, vast, whence figuratively it has acquired the
substantive meaning of a widely extended tract of land; as
the Sea is in English, called the Deep. I conjecture,
therefore, that Morval may be The Enclosed Sea, in
reference to the Loch, which gives names to the towns of
East and West Looe; or, if the substantive and adjective
are inverted, and More resumes its primitive sense, it may
be The Large Inclosure.</p>

<p>Mr. Bond states, in his History of Looe, and of the
neighbourhood, that the principal seat in this parish, and
a place of the same name in Cumberland, belonged to Sir
Hugh de Morville, “a foul disgrace to knighthood’s fair
degree,” one of those villains who murdered Becket at
the altar in Canterbury Cathedral; but the honour of
Cornwall is not stained by the assassin’s birth. The
manor of Morval passed in early times to the family of
Glynn.</p>

<p>Mr. Bond has also preserved a very curious memorial of
the lawless and unsettled state of Cornwall, and probably
of all England, during the contests for plunder, glossed
over by the fiction of adverse rights between two branches
of the Plantagenets.</p>

<p>In the year 1471, John Glynn, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> was barbarously
murdered at Higher Wringworthy, in this parish, by several
ruffians, employed by Thomas Clements, whom he had
superseded in the office of Under-steward of the Duchy.
In the preceding year he had been assaulted and grievously
wounded in the face by the retainers of Clements as he
was holding the King’s Court at Leskeard, and thrown
into Leskeard prison, where he signed a compulsory obligation
<!--253.png--><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a><span class="pageno">247</span>
not to prosecute. Some months preceding the murder,
the retainers of Clements went to Morval, and plundered
the house and premises of goods and chattels to the
value of two hundred pounds and upwards, as then estimated.
All this appears from the petition of Jane Glynn,
the widow, to Parliament, which sets forth, that she could
have no redress for these terrible outrages in the county of
Cornwall, by reason of the general dread of the malice of
Clements and his lawless gang; she prayed, therefore, that
her appeal might be tried in London by a Cornish jury;
and that, in default of Clements appearing to take his trial,
he might be dealt with as convicted and attainted. Her
petition was granted.</p>

<p>The words of Jane Glynn’s petition to Parliament are:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The said Thomas Flete <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> then and there, at four of
the clock in the morning, him feloniously and horribly slew
and murdered, and clove his head in four parts, and gave
him ten deadly wounds in his body; and when he was
dead they cut off one of his legs and one of his arms, and
his head from his body, to make him sure; and over that,
then and there his purse and twenty-two pounds of money
numbered, and a signet of gold, a great signet of silver in
the same purse contained, a double cloke of muster-de-viles,
a sword, and a dagger, to the value of six marks, of
the goods and chattels of the said John Glynn, feloniously
from him they robbed, took, and bore away.”</p>

<p>The following enumeration of the particulars, as contained
in the schedule annexed to Jane Glynn’s petition,
may perhaps be thought interesting, as giving some idea of
the furniture and stock of a gentleman’s mansion in the
reign of Edward the Fourth.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Fourteen oxen, ten kien, a bull, eight hors, sixty bolokis,

<p>In the very early part of the sixteenth century, Richard
Coade, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> married Thomasine, daughter and heiress of
John Glynn, with whom he acquired Morval, and in this
family the manor continued till Anne, the daughter and
heir of John Coade, carried it by her marriage to John
Buller, second son of Francis Buller, of Shillingham.
Their grandson, John-Francis Buller, married Rebecca,
daughter and coheir of Bishop Trelawny; and on the
death of his relation James Buller, of Shillingham, he
succeeded to the family estate, very greatly increased by a
marriage with the heiress of Grosse, a family from Norfolk,
which settled first at Leskeard and afterwards resided in the
parish of Camborne and Trescobays in Budock.</p>

<p>James Buller, son of John-Francis Buller and Rebecca
<!--255.png--><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a><span class="pageno">249</span>
Trelawny, represented the county in Parliament, and died
in 1765.</p>

<p>Mr. Buller married twice, and left Morval, with a considerable
portion of his estate, to John, the eldest son of his
second marriage with Jane Bathurst, daughter of Allen
Bathurst, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> created one of the twelve Peers by Queen
Anne in 1711, and an Earl sixty-one years afterwards by
King George the Third, in 1772. Their second son, Francis,
became one of the Judges of the King’s Bench; and a third
son, Edward, having married a Miss Hoskin, of Looe,
lived and died at Port Looe, in the parish of Tallend.
Their eldest daughter, Jane, married Sir William Lemon,
during fifty years member for the county of Cornwall.</p>

<p>The eldest son of his first marriage settled at Downs,
near Crediton in Devonshire, a property that he acquired
by his marriage with Elizabeth, daughter of William
Gould, of that place, which is now the residence of his
grandson James-Wentworth Buller.</p>

<p>Mr. John Buller resided at Morval, represented Exeter,
Launceston, and West Looe in Parliament; and married
Ann Lemon, only sister of Sir William Lemon. He has
left a numerous family, and is succeeded by his eldest son,
John Buller, this year (1835) Sheriff of the county.</p>

<p>The manor house at Morval is situated in a beautiful

The whole place has been very much improved within the
last thirty years.</p>

The seat next of importance in this parish is Bray.
And Mr. Bond says of it, “Bray, Bre, Brea, in Cornish
signify a hill; and this place is situated on the side of Bindown
Hill. Bray commands very beautiful prospects.”</p>

<p>The manor of Bray, then held under the Vyvyans, as of
their manor of Treviderow, was in the reign of Charles
the Second in the family of Heles, who were succeeded by
the Mayows, of which family was Dr. John Mayow, an
eminent physician in the reign of Charles the Second, who
contributed some papers on Respiration, and other subjects,
to the Philosophical Transactions. Bray is now the
property and occasional residence of Philip-Wynill Mayow,
<abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr></p>

<p>Another account which I have met with states, that Philip
Mayow, of Looe, purchased in the sixth of Elizabeth
(anno 1504) the manor of Bree or Bray, in the parish of
Morval, of Christopher Copplestone, of Warleigh, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>
These accounts, therefore, vary; and which is right I cannot
ascertain.</p>

<p>This Philip Mayow, of Looe, is buried in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s
church, and has the following epitaph:</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>Dr. John Mayow, mentioned by Mr. Bond, and who
has been noticed under <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s, must have been a
<!--257.png--><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a><span class="pageno">251</span>
very extraordinary man, worthy of being ranked with the
first chemists or philosophers of any age.</p>

<p>In the forty-first number of the publications made by the
Royal Society previous to the regular series of the Philosophical
Transactions, anno 1668, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 833, will be found an
account of two works by John Mayow, <abbr title="Doctor of Laws">LL.D.</abbr> and M.D.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tractatus duo. Prior de Respiratione, Alter de Rachitide</span>
(the rickets); see also the Abridgment, <abbr title="volume one page">vol. i. p.</abbr> 295,
where the authors say in a note, “As an account of the life
and opinions of Dr. Mayow was published only a few years
ago by a physician now living, we deem it unnecessary to
insert in this place a biographical notice of this distinguished
chemist and physiologist. We shall only remark,
that in his writings are to be found the primordia of some
of the most important theories and experiments of modern
chemical philosophers.”</p>

<p>The physician alluded to was Thomas Beddoes, of Pembroke
College, Oxford, and afterwards of Clifton, near
Bristol, whose life has been given to the public by Dr.
John Edmonds Stock, in one <abbr title="volume quarto">vol. <abbr title="quarto">4to</abbr></abbr>, printed for Murray
in 1811; and his pamphlet is entitled, “Chemical Experiments
and Opinions extracted from a Work published
in the Last Century. Printed at the Clarendon Press,
Oxford, 1790.”</p>

<p>Doctor Beddoes here bestows on Mayow the praise he
most justly merits, and to be praised by Doctor Beddoes is
laudari a laudato viro. Few persons ever displayed more
genius or power of invention; and to him we mainly owe
the preparation of Humphry Davy for his splendid philosophical
career, after a most fortunate introduction by the
Editor of this Work.</p>

<p>Anthony Wood gives the following particulars of
Mayow:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“John Mayow descended from a genteel family of his
name, living at Bree in Cornwall; was born in the parish

degrees in the civil law, yet he studied physic, and became

books, which show the pregnancy of his parts.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. Bond adds, with respect to this parish, that Polgover,
sometime a seat of the Mayows, still belonging to that
family; and Lydcott (about a mile from thence) a seat of
the family of Hill, now the property of Mr. Braddon, are
both farm houses.</p>

<p>The only place of trade in this parish is a small village,
situated at the spot where the Looe River ceases to be
navigable for barges at high water. There are several
kilns for burning lime, which is used to a great extent
throughout all the neighbourhood as a manure; but the
modern name of Sand Place indicates a recent origin.
Here the canal to Leskeard terminates.</p>

<p>The church is in the same beautiful vale as the manor
house. It contains several monuments in memory of individuals

<p>Bindon is the prominent feature in all this country. It
commands a most extensive prospect over Plymouth, and
to the range of the Dartmoor hills; in the other direction
the view extends to the high lands near <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell, southward
it is bounded by the horizon of the sea, and it almost
reaches <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George’s Channel to the north. The elevation
cannot be less than eight or nine hundred feet; yet strange
to say, the road from Looe to Leskeard still continues to
pass very nearly over the summit of this hill.</p>

of the hospital of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John at Bridgewater.</p>

<p>The great tithes now belong to the family of Trefusis,

<p>This parish forms the north-eastern extremity of the
county, and gives origin to the river Tamar, (Ta-more, the
great water,) which flows to the south coast, there forming
the superb harbour of Plymouth. The portion of Morewinstow
adjoining to the Irish channel, partakes of the
rugged grandeur common to this district. The church
stands near the cliff, commanding a fine view of the sea.
The building is large, containing several fine specimens of
<!--261.png--><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a><span class="pageno">255</span>
gothic architecture. It is also decorated by monuments to
the Kempthornes, Waddons, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Mr. Lysons states, that
the principal villages in this parish are Coumbe, Crosstown,
Eastcot, Gooseham, Hallabeer, Woolford, and Woolley.</p>

<p>He also states, that Stanbury, a seat and manor in this
parish, belonged to a family of the same name, and gave
birth to Richard Stanbury, Bishop of Hereford, who died
in 1471. But Mr. Lysons seems to have fallen into an
error respecting the Christian name of this individual, and
also as to the year of his decease.</p>

<p>John Stanbury was confessor to King Henry the 6th,
and made by him the first Provost of the College, which
that unfortunate king founded at Eton in the 19th year of
his reign, 1440-41. He was made Bishop of Bangor, May
4th, 1448, and translated from thence to Hereford, on the
7th of February, 1453, and died May the 11th, 1474.
Little more seems to be known of this prelate, although he
must have been a man of learning and of much consideration
in his time, and one who may fairly be reckoned among
the distinguished persons of the county. The property
of the Stanburys passed to the family of Mannings, and has
been subdivided among heiresses. The great tithes of this
manor, and of some other lands in the parish, have been
endowed on the vicarage.</p>

<p>Tonacombe belonged to a family said to have changed
their name from Lea to Kempthorne, although the reason
of their doing so is not known. The family resided there
during several descents, till it passed by an heiress about a
hundred and fifty years ago to the Waddons. It has again
passed by a female descent, and is now the property of
William Waddon Martyn, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr></p>

<p>There is also a farm in this parish called Lea, belonging
to George Thynne Carteret, son of Henry Frederick
Thynne, second son of Thomas Thynne, and Louisa Carteret,
daughter of Grace Granville, daughter and coheir of
John Granville, created Earl of Bath by King Charles
the <abbr title="second">2d</abbr>.</p>

<p><!--262.png--><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a><span class="pageno">256</span>
George Thynne Carteret is Baron Carteret, by a creation,
dated <abbr title="January">Jan.</abbr> the 29th, 1784, granted to his father.</p>

<p>This farm may have caused the double names of Kempthorne
and Lea.</p>

<p>Cleave house is said to be pleasantly situated; and Chapel
house, a modern building, was the residence of the
Hammetts, a family from Carmarthenshire, and bequeathed
to Zachariah Hammett Drake, by his maternal uncle. It

<p>By far the greater part of this parish rests on serpentine,
the nature of which is beautifully displayed in Kinance
Cove, where many rocks are highly polished by the action
of the waves, exhibiting a mottled and variegated surface
not unlike the skin of a serpent, from which resemblance
the rock derives its name.</p>

<p>Between Pradanack and the sea, and between the church
and the sea, bounded on the south by the rivulet which flows
to Mullion Cove, there are two patches of hornblende
rocks, both massive and schistose. These rocks are not of
the same nature as the greenstone which occur near the
granite, but resemble those of Porthoustock, Cadgwith,
Landowednack, and other places near the serpentine: it is
therefore very probable that the analysers may detect magnesia
in both the hornblende and the felspar, of which these
rocks are composed. North of a line drawn from the
church to about the middle of Bolerium Cove, the rocks
appear to belong to the calcareous series.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The Editor cannot pass by the mentioning of Kinance
Cove without remarking on the extreme beauty and elegance
of its appearance.</p>

<p>Whenever the granite reaches the shore, and it does so
only with some interruptions for a few miles round the
Land’s End, the cliffs are composed of angular blocks piled
on each other, seeming with masculine strength to defy the
utmost strength of the ocean. At Kinance, on the contrary,
the whole scenery appears feminine. The rocks are
rounded, smooth, polished, and variegated with beautiful
colours; and although they are of large dimensions, yet
every face and every turn is elegant; the very sand that
<!--266.png--><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a><span class="pageno">260</span>
lies between them is of the most fine and shining texture.
No one desirous of viewing the beauties of Cornwall should
neglect to visit this Cove. The serpentine formation, one
of the most rare, is highly interesting to geologists, with its
accompanying diallage, and veins of asbestos and of steatite,
frequently shot through by native copper in the form
of dendrites. Here too the botanist will find various plants
besides the Erica Vagans, peculiar, in Cornwall at least, to
this formation, among which one of the most rare is
the Asparagus Officinalis; and, lastly, the serpentine of
Kinance is now turned in lathes, and made into some of
the most pleasing ornaments for chimney pieces or cabinets.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons gives a very detailed account of the different
manors in this parish, and of the descents and alienations
of each, but wholly uninteresting to any others than the
proprietors.</p>

<p>The principal manor and advowson of the church, which
had been both divided, are most fortunately again united
in the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Richard Gerveys Grylls, since we are indebted
to the taste and to the liberality of this gentleman, for more
<!--268.png--><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a><span class="pageno">262</span>
than restoring the beautiful decorations of the church to
their original splendour.</p>

<p>The church is situated in a pleasing and retired vale,
watered by a branch of the Fowey river, and abounding
with trees; while the country surrounding it, on almost
every side, is even now little cultivated, and must in former
times have been a desert. No situation could be more
adapted for the retreat of an anchorite; and monkish legends
inform us that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Guevor, or Guervier, or Guerer,
fixed his abode at this place; and in after times, the sound
of his name being found to somewhat resemble the French
verb Guerir, to heal, tales were invented of his performing
miraculous cures; and in particular of his having enabled
King Alfred to sit on a horse at the precise moment when
his presence in the field became indispensably necessary to
oppose the pagan Danes.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Guerir ever resided here at all, he must have very
opportunely made way for <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neot, since it is well ascertained
that he also occupied this retreat in the reign of his
brother or relation the Great Alfred.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neot, having withdrawn from the Abbey of Glastonbury,
founded by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Joseph of Arimathea, retired into
this solitude; where he adopted the singular penance
of plunging himself daily into a well of cold water, and
there remaining immersed to his neck till he had repeated
the whole Book of Psalms. The miraculous powers however
bestowed on him by the Almighty, in recompense for
conduct so conducive to the happiness and well-being of
his creatures, forbad <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neot to remain secreted. Multitudes
flocked to him from all parts; he founded a monastery,
and repaired to Rome for a confirmation and for
blessing at the hands of the Pope: these were readily obtained.
He returned to his monastery, where frequent
visits were made to him by King Alfred, on which occasions
he admonished, instructed, and informed the great
founder of English liberty; and finally quitted this mortal
life on the 31st of July, about the year 883, in the odour
<!--269.png--><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a><span class="pageno">263</span>
of sanctity so unequivocal, that travellers all over Cornwall
were solaced by its fragrance. Nor did the exertions
of our Saint terminate with his existence on earth;
he frequently appeared to King Alfred, and sometimes led
his armies in the field. But if the tales of these times are
deserving of any confidence, the nation is really and truly
indebted to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neot for one of the greatest blessings ever
bestowed on it. To his advice, and even to his personal
assistance as a teacher, we owe the foundation by Alfred
of the University at Oxford.</p>

<p>The relics of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neot remained at his monastery in
Cornwall till about the year 974, when Earl Alric, and
his wife Ethelfleda, having founded a religious house at
Eynesbury, in Huntingdonshire, and being at a loss for
some patron saint, adopted the expedient of stealing the
body of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neot; which was accordingly done, and the
town retains his name, thus feloniously obtained, up to the
present time. The monastery in Cornwall continued
feebly to exist after this disaster through the Saxon times;
but having lost its palladium, it felt the roiner’s hand;
and almost immediately after the Norman Conquest, it
was finally suppressed; yet the memory of the local saint
is still cherished by the inhabitants of the parish and of the
neighbourhood, endeared perhaps by the tradition of his
diminutive stature, reduced in their imaginations to fifteen
inches of height; and to these feelings we in all probability
owe the preservation of the painted glass, the great decoration
of this church, and one of the principal works of art
to be seen in Cornwall.</p>

<p>The church itself is of the best description, having a
nave and two aisles of equal length, with a square tower at
the western end, and with the rare addition of an embattled
parapet towards the south, but probably not older than
the fifteenth century, with the exception of some parts of
the walls near the chancel, which seem to have been
a part of the former church. Soon after the new building
had been completed, individuals in some cases, and associations
<!--270.png--><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a><span class="pageno">264</span>
in others, as the unmarried men of the parish, the
unmarried women, and the wives, contributed a window,
either in honour of the local saint, or of their particular
patrons; and the peculiar attachment felt for the little
saint seems to have preserved these fragile materials at the
two important periods of our modern history, the time
when the great change of religion took place, and at that of
the Civil Wars. It may however be recollected that no
violent change occurred here, the monastic institution having
been dissolved by the Earl of Morton, half brother of
the Conqueror; and no place could be more retired from
the observation of strangers, or from the passage of fanatical
armies.</p>

<p>From the time of the Reformation, however, all care
about maintaining these decorations ceased, and the whole
in a few years more would have fallen into utter decay, if
Mr. Grylls had not nobly stepped forwards, not to support
or repair, but to renew these gems; which he has most effectually
done, at an expense not short of two or three
thousand pounds. The church has now sixteen windows
entirely filled with painted glass of the most beautiful colours
and designs; about half of the whole consisting of the
old glass most carefully preserved, and the new added in a
style completely harmonizing with the former: all executed
in London by Mr. J. P. Hedgeland, an eminent
artist, to whose work, with sixteen coloured plates, the
reader is referred for a full description of each window,
and of the various subjects it contains:</p>

<p>On an elevated part of the uncultivated lands which
<!--271.png--><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a><span class="pageno">265</span>
extend for many miles to the north and east of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neot
Church Town, there happens to be a depression without
any channel leading from it; the hollow is, of course, filled
with water, and resting on the granite soil of these moors,
the margin all round is covered by a white siliceous sand,
one of the constituent parts of this compound rock.</p>

<p>Most marvellous stories used to be current respecting
this little lake; no lead could sound the depth of the water,
which rose and fell with the tide, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>:&mdash;but the depth nowhere
exceeds two or three fathoms, and any consent with
the tide is obviously impossible. A tale of a very different
nature, connected with this lake, was as universally repeated,
and more than half believed, sixty years ago.</p>

<p>Tregagle is the name of a family not long extinct. Mr.
Lysons says Tregagle, of Trevorder, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Breock; arms,
Argent, three bucks passant Or. One of this family having,
for some reason, become unpopular, the traditions respecting
a mythological personage have been applied to
him. The object of these tales of unknown antiquity was,
like Orestes, continually pursued by an avenging being,
from whom he could find refuge only from time to time,
by flying to the cell or chapel on Roach Rock; till at last
his fate was changed into the performance of a task, to exhaust
the water from Dozmere, with an implement less
adapted, if possible, for its appropriate work, than were the
colanders given to the daughters of Danaus:</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
  <div class="i0">Hocc’, ut opinor, id est, ævo florente puellas,</div>
  <div class="i0">Quod memorant, laticem pertusum congerere in vas,</div>
  <div class="i0">Quod tamen expleri nulla ratione potestur.</div>
</div>

<p>Tregagle is provided simply with a limpet shell, having
a hole bored through it; and with this he is said to labour
without intermission; in dry seasons, flattering himself that
he has made some progress towards the end of his work;
but when rain commences, and the “omnis effusus labor”
becomes apparent, he is believed to roar so loudly, in utter
despair, as to be heard from Dartmoor Forest to the
Land’s End.</p>

<p><!--272.png--><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a><span class="pageno">266</span>
The name of this small lake, about a mile in circumference,
has excited much curiosity, remaining still unsatisfied.
I approach etymology with diffidence, proposing
nothing but as a conjecture. On the second syllable
of Doz-mere indeed there has not been a doubt, it is
understood on all hands to mean a lake; now Doz is said
in our glossaries to agree with the English verb to come,
but that joined with water it means the tide; may not Doz-mere
then represent the currently received opinion of these
waters ebbing and flowing, and mean literally the tide lake?
The English termination, utterly destructive of its dignity
or importance, is at all events unnecessary to the sense.</p>

<p>A line drawn <abbr title="Northwest and Southeast">N. W. and S. E.</abbr> about half a mile north
of the church town, will divide this parish so into two unequal
parts, that the northern, by far the most extensive,
will be found to rest on granite, forming a barren waste for
several miles in extent; its valleys, however, have afforded
stream tin in considerable quantities, and of the very best
quality, rendering it therefore probable that this valuable
and rare metal may exist in the granite more than has generally
been supposed. The other portion of the parish is
situated on slate, resembling that of the parishes of Cardinham

of Exeter. I take this to be what in Mr. Camden is called
Caeling, or I do not know where else you will find that
place. There are many ruins at Cargol, which show that it
must have been once a considerable place. A large prison
is still standing there, although now scarcely used, and a
barn of the same size; both show something of its pristine
glory, although as to the rest it be but a sorry village of
three or four poor houses.</p>

Humphrey Borlase, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> of this place, was Sheriff of
Cornwall in the third and fourth years of King James the
Second, in the commission of the peace and lieutenancy,
and also a member of parliament; but following the fortunes
of that king, (by whom it is said that he was created
Baron of Mitchell, at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Germain’s,) he ran out a large
estate, and died a prisoner for debt in the Fleet; and soon
after his decease, this place, with several other lands, were
sold under a decree in chancery, to Sir William Scawen,
and the lease of the manor of Cargol held under the Bishop
to Philip Hawkins, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> to whose son, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Hawkins,
<abbr title="Doctor of Divinity">D.D.</abbr> it at present belongs. From hence originated
the well-known apple, the Treludra or Borlase’s pippin;
but the place is so much fallen to decay that no traces remain
of the house, nor even of the orchard. [The small
dwelling of a farmer, and a few stumps of trees, alone mark
the spot. <abbr title="Editor">Ed.</abbr>]</p>

<p>To the south of Treludra, just in from the downs, stands
the borough of Mitchell, the best part of which being in
this parish, as the rest is in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Eroder, Mr. Browne Willis
thus describes it: “Mitchell is a small hamlet, scarce containing
thirty houses, all cottages save one, which is a
public inn, not long since erected, which is the only healed
(slated) house in this poor borough. Concerning the antiquity
of this borough, and when it was created so, I have
little to say; but that it first sent members to parliament
in the sixth year of Edward the Sixth, in which return it
is called villa Mychell, as it is in all the ancient indentures,
styled burgus or villa Mychell, Mitchell, or Modishole.
Mr. Carew calls it Meddleschale, the name Mitchell never
occurring till in modern times.</p>

<p>The manor of this place is still in possession of the ancient
family of Arundell, of Lanherne, whose ancestor, Ralph
de Arundell, purchased the same in the time of Henry the
Third, by whose interest, I presume, with Richard Earl of
Cornwall, King of the Romans, this little town obtained
the privileges of a market and fairs. In anno the thirtieth
<!--275.png--><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a><span class="pageno">269</span>
Edward the First, John de Arundell (grandson of the aforesaid
Ralph, who had been Sheriff of Cornwall in the forty-fourth
of Henry the Third,) certified his claim to a market
and fair in his manor of Modishole, which he challenged
by hereditary descent from Ralph de Arundell, his
ancestor, and pleaded that the said Ralph purchased this
manor of Piers de Ralegh, heir of Walter de Ralegh.</p>

<p>The manor of Degembris was one of those forfeited by
Francis Tregian, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> (see Probus). It was either given
or sold to John Arundell, of Trerise, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> by King Charles
the First.</p>

<p>In this manor Pallamaunter, or Palmaunter, was formerly
a gentleman’s seat, and gave name to an ancient
family since removed to Trevyrick, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Columb Minor.</p>

<p>The manor of Tresulion. Here it is said was born Sir
Robert Tresulion, or Tresilian, Lord Chief Justice of England
under Richard the Second, though some say he was
born at another place. It certainly however belonged to a
family of that name, till it went, or rather the barton, with
a female heir, to a branch of the Carnes of Glamorganshire.
The manor went probably, by purchase, to the
Arundells. But in the year 1599, Thomas Davies, of Canon
Teign, in Devon, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> seized the barton under a mortgage,
and his descendant, Mary, widow of Sir George
Cary, of Clovelly, in Devonshire, sold it to &mdash;&mdash; Gully,
<abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> who settled himself there, from whom, having lost
all his children, it devolved on his nephew Samuel Gully,
<abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr></p>

<p>The manor of Treworthen was the seat of a very considerable
family, of which Walter de Treworthen, or Treworden,
was Sheriff of Cornwall 7th of Henry the Third,
as was Sir Otho de Treworthen 4th Henry the Fifth, and
Sir John de Treworthen was knight of the shire 21st
Richard the Second. The arms of Treworthen were Argent,
three boar’s heads couped Sable, armed Gules. This
manor, now reduced nearly to the barton, is the property
of Wills, of Wivelscomb, a minor.</p>

<p>The church stands on an elevated ridge, and is conspicuous,
with its lofty tower, from great distances; both are
built with stone common in that district, which is hard, and
capable of forming permanent structures; but the laminated
surface of the stone, and its colour, approaching to
olive, are quite unfavourable to exterior beauty. The inside
of the church consists of two long aisles, extending east
and west, with a short cross aisle on either side; the
north cross aisle being appropriated to the manor of Cargol,
and that on the other side to Tresilian. The old
carved work of this church has not been destroyed, and
therefore much decoration may be seen on the seats, presenting
the arms of various families, figures, monograms, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>Under the eastern part of the church remains a vault

of the walls over it is a handsome monument to Margaret
Arundell, wife of John Lord Arundell, and daughter of Sir
John Acland, who died in 1691. From this connection,

<p>The leasehold property of this manor, purchased by Mr.
Philip Hawkins, remained in his family till his great
grandson, the late Sir Christopher Hawkins, acquired the
freehold in the year 1804 or 5, under the authority of
parliament, for redeeming the Land Tax from the See of
Exeter.</p>

<p>The other portion of the Borlase property, sold to Sir
William Scawen, has not remained so permanently in the
possession of any family. Treludra, and its appendages,
had certain incorporeal rights, which made them objects of
peculiar attention. Mr. Scawen, who inherited this property
from the original purchaser, sold it to Mr. Basset,
afterwards Lord de Dunstanville; and about the year 1798 it
was finally sold to Sir Christopher Hawkins, who thus
united again the Borlase property in this neighbourhood.</p>

<p>It is now needless to investigate the constitution of the
little borough of Michell, further than to state that the
right of voting for Members of Parliament had been determined
to reside in five individuals, holding certain nominal
tenures within the borough, and denominated mesne lords,
and in such persons living within the borough, as paid
<!--278.png--><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a><span class="pageno">272</span>
scot and lot. These last were in latter times reduced to
four, so as to constitute the five mesne lords a majority.</p>

<p>Nothing could primâ facie appear more absurd, or bear
more the appearance of a childish mockery of representation.
But in point of fact, this and other close boroughs
had nothing to do with representation at all, in the sense
usually applied to that word: they were fortuitous contrivances
giving weight to property, and restraining an
assembly partly delegated, and thereby possessing a strong
spirit of freedom, within such bounds as allowed distinct
branches of government to co-exist with this otherwise all
powerful body. They are now swept away, and new institutions
seem fast arising; but whether these shall prove advantageous
to the happiness and to the welfare of mankind,
or the contrary, our posterity will be more able to
decide. They may perhaps discover that the apparent
obstacles in our Constitution, really contained the secret
springs which gave a regulated motion to the British Government,
when it was esteemed the wonder and the admiration
of the world.</p>

<p>A large extent of waste ground, belonging to the Treludra
purchase, having been enclosed, and efforts made to
bring it into cultivation by various methods, and among
these by folding sheep, it received the name of Shepherds.
The late Sir Christopher Hawkins continued with eagerness
what he found commenced; and trying the expedient
of ploughing deep, to remove the stratum of shattered siliceous
spar, which occurs immediately under the peaty turf
of all such lands throughout Cornwall, lead ore was brought
to the surface; when this spirited individual, who is said
to have expended five thousand pounds a year in wages for
a considerable length of time, began a mine at his own expense,
and encouraged by its first efforts he brought in an
adit, erected more than one steam engine, and wrought the
mine to a very considerable depth. The quantity of lead raised
from the mine proved sufficient to pay all the expenses, and
in addition, the lead was found to be rich in silver, much
above the general average of such as are usually tested.</p>

<p><!--279.png--><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a><span class="pageno">273</span>
All the operations were conducted on the place. The
ores were smelted, silver to the amount of some tens of
thousands of pounds value was extracted from the lead,
and the litharge again revived.</p>

<p>In all these matters Sir Christopher Hawkins was mainly
assisted by one whose name I am happy to record.</p>

<p>Mr. John Giddy was born in January 1760, and having
received the common school education, he found himself
compelled to waste the greater part of his life in an inferior
situation at a tin smelting house. He had however
the advantage of much leisure, which he employed in the
cultivation of his mind and in the acquirement of knowledge;
and without any apprehension of my judgment being
warped in favour of one, whom I have esteemed more
as a brother than a relation, throughout a period exceeding
fifty years, I will venture to say that in matters connected
with chemistry and practical science, few excelled him;
that in honour and integrity he was excelled by none; and
that in more recondite studies, even in the acquirement of
foreign literature, his progress much more resembled what
might be expected from persons having every artificial
advantage in life, than from him who had been in a great
measure deprived of them all. He never married, and
died suddenly in last January (1835), at Shepherds, having
just completed his seventy-fifth year.</p>

Mr. Lysons says that a manor, called the manor of
Newlyn, belonged to the other branch of the Arundells&mdash;that
of Lanherne. It may, however, be remarked that a
manor bearing the name of a parish is frequently limited to
a very small part of that with which it would seem to
be co-extensive: in such cases the manor probably derives
its name from the church having been built on it.</p>

<p>Sir John Arundell, who was Sheriff of Cornwall in the
10th year of Edward the Fourth, lost his life in an attack
on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount, then recently seized by Richard
de Vere, Earl of Oxford. This gentleman had removed
his residence from Efford, on the coast near Stratton, and
amidst the sands, to Trerice; and these circumstances gave
origin to one of the thousand idle tales invented on such
occasions, and which the diffused intelligence of the present
time has scarcely yet eradicated,&mdash;that some foreteller of
future events had warned him of dying in the sand, that he
went from Efford to counteract the will of fate, which became
accomplished however at the foot of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount.</p>

<p>The Sir John Arundell, mentioned by Mr. Tonkin as
known by the name of “John for the King,” and as living
to a great age, defended Pendennis Castle with the utmost
bravery, after he had passed his eightieth year; and his
son, Sir Richard Arundell, distinguished himself at several
battles in the Civil War. This gentleman, soon after the
Restoration of King Charles the Second, was created Lord
Arundell, of Trerice; his grandson, the last heir male,
died in 1773.</p>

here saith, “this town is ancient, bearing the name of Lodenek
in Cornish, and in English after the true and old

there taketh King Adelstane for the chief giver of privileges

<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Petroc’s Place, to whom this church is
by all allowed to be dedicated, and who most probably was
born here; as more certain it is that he was buried in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Petroc’s church in Bodmin, as you may see there.</p>

<p>But Fuller (Worthies in Wales, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 13), from Bale calls
Petrok, a Welsh-Irish-Cornish man, as having his birth in
Wales, his breeding in Ireland (according to the custom
of that age), from whence after twenty years’ studying he
came into Cornwall, and fixed himself at Petrok’s-stowe,
now corruptly Padstowe, from a small oratory so called
from him; that he wrote a book of Solitary Life, whereto
he was much addicted, and flourished anno 560; but Collier
from Harpsfield, whose authority I prefer, makes him
to go from Cornwall into Ireland, so that as I said before
we may claim the honour of his birth.</p>

<p>Leland says, that the name of this Athelstow indicates
its being founded by Athelstan on his conquest of Cornwall,
but this appears mere conjecture, unsupported by the
slightest authority; in contradiction to the orthography
used in the Valuation by the Bishops of Winchester and
Lincoln in 1291, where the name is Aldestowe, not Athelstowe;
and Athelstan’s conquest took place more than
three centuries and a half after the death of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Petroc.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitaker conjectures that the original monastic
establishment of this Saint occupied the spot, since inhabited
by one of greater learning, and we may fairly presume
imbued with a more deep infusion of real piety,
the well known and respected author of the Connection of
The Old and New Testament, and of a variety of other
works, all evincing his profound erudition, strong abilities,
and goodness of heart.</p>

<p><!--285.png--><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a><span class="pageno">279</span>
The Prideauxes are understood to have held this property
before the Reformation under a lease for lives from the
priors of Bodmin, who appear to have been high lords, at
least, of the whole town.</p>

<p>Mr. Carew, after noticing Padstow, and referring to a
charter of incorporation which unquestionably never had
any existence, says, “Mr. Nicholas Prideaux, from his new
and stately house thereby, taketh a full and large prospect
of the town, haven, and country adjoining, to all which
his wisdom is a stay, his authority a direction. He married
one of Viel’s coheirs; and, though endowed with fair revenues
in Devon, maketh Cornwall beholden to his residence.
He beareth, Argent, a chevron Sable, in chief a
file with three lambeaux Gules.” <abbr title="page">P.</abbr> 144; 340, Lord de
Dunstanville’s <abbr title="edition">edit.</abbr></p>

<p>This family appears to have been greatly benefited by
the confiscations of those times, since the Devonshire
branch acquired all the ecclesiastical possessions of Bodmin
Priory, and what had been held under lease from the
monastery about Padstow, became converted into freehold;
and soon after the possession could be considered as assured,
Mr. Nicholas Prideaux built this house, which continues
to be one of the most handsome and imposing of all
the gentlemen’s houses in Cornwall. The exterior retains
its original appearance, the interior has received various
and recent improvements; a splendid staircase is understood
to have been brought from Stowe in Kilkhampton.
The late Mr. Charles Prideaux went into holy orders
during the life of his elder brother; and afterwards assumed
the name of Brune in addition to Prideaux on his succeeding
to the estate of that family. He married Miss Patten,
sister of Mr. Peter Patten Bowles; they have left one son,
who is married to Miss Glynn, and three daughters, the
eldest married to Mr. Sawle, of Penrice.</p>

<p>The church is handsome and spacious, and is said to
have been built by Thomas Vivian, Prior of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Petroc’s,
Bodmin, and titular Bishop of Megara in Greece. It contains
<!--286.png--><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a><span class="pageno">280</span>
several monuments to the Prideaux family, and to
others.</p>

<p>The town is not large, and the harbour is so surrounded
by rocks and obstructed by sand, that vessels even of a
small size are unable to find shelter there when the wind
blows on the shore, and security is much wanted. Plans
have been suggested for constructing a mole from the
eastern side of the harbour, near its entrance, so as to
greatly narrow the opening, and by so doing give power to
the very extensive back-water to deepen the channel, and
this work, with the removal of some rocks, would, it is
believed, make Padstow a safe place of refuge for all ships
navigating <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George’s Channel or the Severn sea; but
the expense must far exceed all that could be contributed
to a private undertaking, and therefore no hope can be entertained
of such an improvement being made, unless the
forming of a safe harbour in such a situation should be
deemed worthy of becoming a national work.</p>

<p>A considerable trade was brought to this part about the
middle of the last century by Mr. William Rawlings, who,
emerging from a shop at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Columb, raised himself, and
conferred benefits on all around him by an union of talent,
industry, and integrity. He was succeeded by his son Mr.
Thomas Rawlings, who served the office of Sheriff in the
year 1803, and built a large house just out of the town,
named Saunder’s Hill; but various concerns having proved
less successful in the latter part of his life, and leaving a
large family, the property has been sold, and the house taken
down.</p>

<p>It is a curious and singular occurrence respecting the
tithes of this parish, that they have been split; probably in
consequence of leases granted by the priory of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Petroc.
The Prideaux family have continued to possess the tithe
of fish, and some other advantages, while the general tithes
of the parish belong to a gentleman of the name of Hall.</p>

<p>There are said to have been several chapels in the
parish; one dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Sampson, not to the Jewish
<!--287.png--><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a><span class="pageno">281</span>
Hercules, but to a native of Glamorganshire, born in the
fifth century, who after spending years in solitude, converting
whole nations, performing miracles, and in Britany raising
a man from the dead, founded the splendid abbey of Dole
in Franche Comté, where he died on the 6th of July in
564. This chapel is believed to have been built on the
ruins of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Petroc’s monastery, destroyed by the Danes in
981, and therefore on the spot now occupied by Mr. Prideaux’s
house, which would be called Padstow Place, but
for the alliteration.</p>

<p>Another chapel stood in a direction from the town, now
distinguished by one of the most beautiful walks any where
to be seen, when the high water overflows the sand of this
extensive estuary.</p>

<p>This chapel, called <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Saviour’s, in common with
various others in similar situations, was dedicated by
navigators to our Lord, in a capacity very limited with
respect to that of the Redeemer of the whole world from
the destruction caused by original sin; they made it only
as a votive offering in return for their own temporal preservation
from shipwreck.</p>

<p>An account is given in a black-letter pamphlet, written
by G. Classe, of Torrington in Devonshire, of a most
melancholy domestic tragedy which took place in this town
early in the reign of King James the First, arising entirely
from the violent spirit of fanaticism then raging in men’s
minds with ten-fold fury in consequence of recent persecution
and existing intolerance. The details had better be
forgotten.</p>

<p>Present Vicar, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William Rawlings, instituted in
1790.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>The rocks of this parish are somewhat similar to those
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mervyn, which is already stated to belong to the calcareous
series. The rocks are well exposed on the shores
of Padstow harbour, and therefore they merit a more particular
description.</p>

<p>The southern part of this parish consists chiefly of a
blue slate, which in some strata is very fissile, and in other
strata it separates into thick lamellar pieces, and passes in
the adjoining strata into calcareous schist. This slate at
Dinah’s Cave contains a bed of black limestone, which
may be a continuation of that on the opposite side of the
harbour at Rock ferry. At the latter place, the transitions
between the blue slate and the limestone are beautifully displayed.</p>

<p>The limestone is of the same nature as that in Veryan
on the south coast. Proceeding towards Slepper Point, at
the entrance of the harbour, after passing the town of
Padstow, the cliffs consist of alternate beds of compact and
of schistose greenstone; these continue to line the shore with
broken rocks for more than a mile, and they are succeeded
by red and greenish slates, which are lamellar, of a fine texture,
and rather hard, resembling the mineral called novaculite
or hornestone; and connected with this slate occurs
<!--289.png--><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a><span class="pageno">283</span>
a compact crystalline rock like that of Trevose Head in
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mervyn, consisting of small crystals of glossy felspar,
and of a scaly pulverulent mineral of a greenish colour, the
nature of which is not very apparent. This singular rock
may be the equivalent of diallage rock, a member of the
serpentine series, as its position bears a great resemblance
to that of the Lizard magnesian rocks.</p>

<p>At Penniscen Bay, on the north side of the parish, the
cliff exhibits many alternations of limestone and slate; this
limestone is more crystalline than the black limestone of
Rock Ferry, approaching nearer to the Plymouth limestone
in its appearance; but organic remains have not yet
been discovered in it.</p>

<p>The slate between the beds of limestone is a calcareous
schist, and is of a white colour, and earthy where it has
been weathered; but when perfect it is found, especially
near the limestone, to be of a blue colour with broad
diagonal bands or stripes of brown, precisely like the calcareous
slate which occurs in Werrington, near Yealm
Bridge, where it is extensively quarried for chimney-pieces,
and for other domestic or ornamental purposes.</p>

Eadbald, King thereof, receiving them with all kindness,

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>It is universally understood that this parish is not dedicated
to the great apostle of Tarsus; and it is rather a
curious circumstance that the word saint, so generally used
as a prefix to the names of parishes in Cornwall, should
invariably be omitted in this instance.</p>

<p>The honour of protecting the parish of Paul has been
<!--291.png--><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a><span class="pageno">285</span>
given by conjecture to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul de Leon, a native of Cornwall,
celebrated as a founder of monasteries, as a zealous and
successful champion of the faith in converting the Pagans
of Britany, where he was made the first bishop of the
town, since called from him <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Pol de Leon; but, not
satisfied with the services that he might render to God and
man, in this important station, amidst newly converted
Christians, he endeavoured to make himself more useful by
retiring into a solitude, where he died on the 12th of March,
about the year 573, and nearly in the hundredth year of
his age.</p>

<p>The parish feast is celebrated on the nearest Sunday to
October the 10th; and although this saint is generally commemorated
on the 12th of March, the day of his decease,
yet in his own city of Leon the very 10th of October is
consecrated to his memory: which, together with his being a
Cornish man, seems to fix <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul de Leon as the Patron
Saint, in opposition to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paulinus the first Archbishop of
York, who was sent by Pope Gregory the Great into England
shortly after the mission of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austin; his festival is
held on October the 12th.</p>

<p>This church and that of Breage were attached to the
mitred abbey of Hailes in Gloucestershire, as founded by
one of the greatest promoters of monastic establishments
on record, Richard King of the Romans and Earl of
Cornwall. He began the building in 1246; and in 1251,
when he had expended ten thousand marks in finishing
the monastery, he had the church dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary on
the 9th of November, in the presenee of the King and
Queen, thirteen Bishops, most of the Barons, and above
three hundred Knights, all of whom he entertained with
incredible state and plenty, letting fall this generous and
devout expression: “I wish it had pleased God that all
my great expenses in my Castle of Wallingford had been
as wisely and soberly employed.”</p>

<p>Edmund Earl of Cornwall, son and heir of Richard the
founder, having, in his travels through Germany with his
<!--292.png--><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a><span class="pageno">286</span>
father, obtained a relic considered to be blood of our
Saviour, gave a third part to this monastery in 1272, thereby
causing a great increase in the number of people resorting
to it.</p>

<p>In the return made to King Henry the Eighth, preserved
in the Augmentation Office, of the property belonging
to this monastery, are these entries:</p>

<p>This reign, more unsettled, and more disturbed by domestic
wars throughout its whole extent than any other, was nevertheless
most fertile in the production of monasteries;
and the honour and castle of Wallingford, accidentally
united with the Duchy of Cornwall in the person of Richard
Plantagenet, King of the Romans, remained so till it was
taken in exchange by Henry the Eighth for certain manors
and lands in Cornwall, known as the new Duchy holdings.</p>

<p>A great part of the lands surrendered by the Abbey of
Hailes are in possession of the Tracy family; but the impropriated
tithes of Paul belonged, in the early part of
the last century, to the family of Gwavas, since which time
they have passed with two coheiresses to Veale and Carlyon.</p>

<p>The church is placed a little beyond the brow of a lofty
ridge ascending from the sea, so that it is not much seen,
but the tower rising above the ridge is visible from a great
distance. The church is large, and contains several monuments
to members of different families,&mdash;Godolphin, Pendarves,
Hitchins, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>In this parish are situated Mousehole and Newlyn, two
towns of pretty considerable size, although, being very near
to Penzance, they have not any regular market.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mousehole</span>, formerly called Porth Enys, the Island Port,
on account of a small island close in upon the shore, had
in remote times not the privilege merely, but the actual possession
of a market and fairs, but having been destroyed by
<!--293.png--><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a><span class="pageno">287</span>
a predatory invasion of some Spaniards in July 1595, and
Penzance rising fast into importance, the practice of holding
them has been discontinued ever since.</p>

<p>Mr. Carew, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 156 (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 381 of Lord de Dunstanville’s
edition), gives a detailed account of this invasion, which is
said to have occasioned the capture of Cadiz by a combined
English and Dutch squadron in the ensuing year. In
Paul church is the following inscription, recording the
savage conduct of these invaders:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The Spanyer burnt this church in the year 1595.”</p>

<p>And the parish register commences with this notice:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Register of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Pawle in the countie of Cornwall, from
the 23 daye of Julie, the year of our gracious Lord God
1595, on which daie, soon after the sun was risen, the
church, tower, bells, and all other things pertaining to the
same, together with the houses and goods, was burned and
spoiled by the Spaniards in the said parish, being Wensdaie
the daye aforesaid, in the 37th year of the raigne of
our Soveraine Ladie Elezabeth, by the grace of God of
England, France, and Ireland Queene, Defender of the
Faith, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p class="p0 sigright">“Per me, <span class="sc">Joh’nem Tremearne</span>, Vicarium.”</p>

<p>Entries, 1595:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Jenken Keigwyn, of Mousehole, being killed by the
Spaniards, was buried the 24th of Julie.</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jacobus de Newlyn occisus fuit per inimicos, et sepultus
est 26 die Julie.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Similiter Teek Cornall, et sepultus the 26 Julie.”</p>

<p>The cannon ball which caused the death of Mr. Keigwyn,
the principal inhabitant of the place, is still preserved;
and to within these few years an implacable hatred was entertained
against the very name of a Spaniard.</p>

<p>There is said to have been a chapel at Mousehole; and
another, on the island dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clement, served probably
for <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount, as the island is understood to
remain an appendage to that place.</p>

<p><!--294.png--><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a><span class="pageno">288</span>
No satisfactory account has ever been given of the
change of name from Porth Enys to the ludicrous one now
in use; there is indeed a cavern at some distance beyond,
spacious, lofty, and strewed with large rocks, therefore as
unlikely to suggest the name as any thing that can well be
imagined. It most likely arose from some trifling circumstance
now forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Newlyn</span> is somewhat larger than Mousehole, having
annexed to it a collection of houses called by a mixture of
English and Cornish, “Street Nowan,” the New street.</p>

<p>Both the towns are provided with a pier capable of sheltering
small vessels, and above all of protecting the immense
assemblage of boats employed in the seine fishery, and
in driving for pilchards, mackarel, and herrings; from
which large supplies, especially of mackarel, are sent in
the spring to London, and pilchards exported to the
amount of several thousand hogsheads.</p>

<p>The principal family of this parish in early times was
probably Keigwin. To Mr. John Keigwin, born in 1641,
we are indebted for the Translations of Mount Calvary,
and of the Creation of the World with Noah’s Flood, both
of which have been printed by the Editor of this Work,
with the original Cornish on the opposite pages; he died
about the year 1710. The affairs of the Keigwins got entangled
in family disputes, accompanied by protracted litigation
in the Court of Chancery, which occasioned their
estates to be sold in parcels, and thus gave rise to the extraordinary
number of freeholders in the parish of Paul.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons gives the history of several manors, but they
do not contain any thing curious.</p>

<p>The younger branch of the Godolphins, which settled at
Treworveneth, having acquired it by a marriage with the
daughter and heiress of John Cowling of that place, became
extinct by the death of Col. William Godolphin
in 1689.</p>

<p>Trungle was the seat of Mr. Hitchens, and afterwards
became the residence of Capt. Clutterbuck, a gentleman
<!--295.png--><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a><span class="pageno">289</span>
from Kent, who came into Cornwall as commandant of the
garrison at Scilly. He married a Cornish lady, and settled
there. His son practised the law at Marazion.</p>

<p>The late Mr. John Price commenced the formation of a
pretty retreat in a small declivity near the ridge of this
parish, at a place called Chi-owne, the house in a croft.
Trees were found to flourish there, and the whole promised
so much that his son Mr. Rose Price began to lay the foundation
of a handsome seat on an adjoining farm; and he
went so far as to construct an immense mound to act as a
shelter for trees, and also to give them an elevation on its
slope, a work which the country people named “The Chinese
Wall:” the whole was, however, discontinued for
want of sufficient space, which was afterwards afforded in
the adjacent parish of Maddern by the purchase of Trengwainton.</p>

<p>It is not easy to imagine a more beautiful view than the
one obtained from the summit of the hill above Newlyn;
the ascent is, however, extremely steep, and in consequence
a new line of road has been projected; but the
great value and subdivision of land will probably defeat
the execution of a plan having more for its object the decoration
of the country than any facility of communication,
although that would be found important.</p>

<p>Not far from the top of this hill is erected a small stone
monument by the late Mr. John Price, to commemorate a
circumstance scarcely deserving of such attention, which
was no more than the finding of a gold ring with the
motto on it, “In hac spe vivo.” Mr. Price indeed conjectured
that it had belonged to some gentleman engaged in
the remote Plantagenet Civil Wars, and with much ingenuity
contrived a series of adventures to suit the occasion
and the sentiment.</p>

<p>Another curiosity, discovered much about the same
time, is far more deserving of regard. Of this Mr. Lysons
has given an engraved plate with the following description:</p>

<p class="blockquote"><!--296.png--><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a><span class="pageno">290</span>
“In 1783, one of the ancient British ornaments of gold,
in the form of a crescent, with a narrow zigzag pattern
slightly engraven on it, and weighing two ounces, four penny
weights, and six grains, was discovered near the remains
of one of the circular earthworks in the neighbourhood of
Penzance. This curious relic is now in the possession of
Rose Price, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>”</p>

<p>Gold ornaments, similar if not identical with this very
curious remnant of remote antiquity, have been found in
other parts of this island, and also in Ireland. One very
like it in bronze, taken from a stream pool in 1802, is in
the possession of Mr. William Rashleigh at Menabilly.</p>

<p>Objects so interesting have not failed of exciting investigation
and conjecture; and they have been fancied to be
a decoration of the chief priest among the Druids, worn
round his head, and indicating by the crescent shape the
exact age of the moon best adapted for ensuring the
greatest possible virtues to the holy misletoe, which was
then to be severed from its parent oak.</p>

<p>Paul measures 2,865 statute acres.</p>

<p>A narrow belt of slate, belonging to the porphyritic

the village of Mousehole; it consists for the most part of
hard massive and schistose varieties of compact felspar,
occasionally spotted or intimately blended with actynolite
and hornblend, or with some mineral intermediate between
them. The rest of this parish is situated on granite, exhibiting

<p>The site of this monastery was granted by Queen Elizabeth
to Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, but sold by

<p>But the place of greatest note in this parish is Trelawn,
for more than two centuries the principal seat of the Trelawnys;
but, notwithstanding the great similarity of the two
names, not having any connection one with the other, although,
by a temptation too strong to be withstood, the
place has recently been known by the name of its proprietor.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE HISTORY, AS GIVEN BY MR. BOND.</p>

<p>This place, at an early period, belonged to the Bodrigans.
<!--300.png--><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a><span class="pageno">294</span>
Sir Henry de Bodrigan gave it as a marriage portion
with his daughter to Henry Champernowne. The
heiress of this branch of the Champernownes married Polglass
Herle. Sir John Herle the younger, who died without
issue, settled the reversion of Trelawn on Sir William
Bonville, the last of an ancient Devonshire family (summoned
to Parliament <abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> the <abbr title="twenty-third">23d</abbr>, in the 28th year of
Henry the Sixth, as Baron Bonville, which barony in fee
became forfeited by the attainder of his great-grandson
Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, in the first year of Philip
and Mary. <abbr title="Editor">Ed.</abbr>) It was a very remarkable circumstance
attending this family, that the havoc of Civil War annihilated
three generations within the space of two months.
At the battle of Wakefield Lord Bonville witnessed the
death of his son Sir William Bonville, and of his grandson
William Lord Harrington, who enjoyed that title according
to the custom of those days, as having married Elizabeth,
the daughter and heiress of Lord Harrington, of
Harrington, possessed of a barony in fee. This battle took
place on the last day of December 1460. And in the
month of February following the aged grandfather, Lord
Bonville himself, was taken prisoner at the second battle of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Alban’s, and although his life had been promised, he was
beheaded by the order of Queen Margaret, who bore resentment
against him, as being one of those who had custody of
the king’s person after the battle of Northampton. Elizabeth
Lady Harrington, after the accession of Edward the Fourth,
had a large dower assigned her out of Lord Bonville’s estates
in Cornwall. Her only daughter by Bonville brought
Trelawn, and other estates, to Thomas Grey, Marquis of
Dorset. On the attainder of his grandson Henry Duke
of Suffolk, they were seized by the Crown. Queen Elizabeth,
in the <abbr title="forty-second">42d</abbr> year of her reign, sold the manor of Trelawn
and the lands of Hendersich and Portello, in Talland
prrish, to Sir Jonathan Trelawny. The old and famous
family of Trelawny take their name from the barton of
Trelawny, in the parish of Alternun. The arms of this
<!--301.png--><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a><span class="pageno">295</span>
family are Argent, a chevron Sable, sometimes charged with
three oak-leaves Proper.</p>

<p>It is said that Sir John Trelawny was so eminent in the
wars of France, that King Henry the Fifth, on the 27th
of September, in the seventh year of his reign, at Gison in
Normandy, granted him £20 yearly for life, as a just recompense
for his signal services; and that Henry the Sixth
was pleased to confirm it to him in the first year of his
reign, and granted to him an augmentation to his arms,
the three oak-leaves. He was certainly the first of this
family who bore that addition. Under the picture of
Henry the Fifth, which stood formerly on the gate at
Launceston, was this rhyme:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">He that will do aught for me,</div>
  <div class="i0">Let him love well Sir John Trelawnee.</div>
</div>

<p>There was an ancient saying in Cornwall, That a Godolphin
was never known to want wit, a Trelawny courage,
or a Glanville loyalty.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons says, Lord Bonville built a castellated mansion
at Trelawny, a part of which, with two towers, remain on
the eastern side of the present house. Sir John Trelawny
nearly rebuilt the house, soon after his purchase of the estate.
It was again nearly rebuilt by Edward Trelawny, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> Governor
of Jamaica, after a fire, which happened about the
middle of the last century. There are several family portraits
in the house, two of the Bishop of Winchester; he
built a chapel there, on the site of a former one, and the
following inscription remains:</p>

<p class="center">“This Chapel was consecrated by the Right <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr><br />
Father in God, Sir Jonathan Trelawny, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> Lord Bishop<br />
of Exeter, on Monday, <abbr title="twenty-third">23d</abbr> day of November,<br />
Anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 1701.”</p>

<p>Without adverting to ancient times, two members of this
family have been distinguished in times more recent,
Doctor Jonathan Trelawny, and one of his sons, Edward
Trelawny, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr></p>

<p><!--302.png--><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a><span class="pageno">296</span>
Of the first Wood says, in his Athenæ Oxonienses:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Jonathan Trelawny, son of Sir Jonathan Trelawny, of
Trelawny, in Cornwall, Baronet, was born, as I have been
informed, at Pelent, or Pelynt, in the same county, educated
at Westminster School, entered into Christ Church
in Michaelmas Term 1668, aged 18 (born therefore in
1650); and in the year following was made student
thereof. Afterwards he took the degrees in arts, holy
orders, and one or two benefices in his own county, conferred
upon him by his relations.</p>

<p>In 1680 his eldest brother died, and thereupon, though
the title of baronet and the paternal estate of his family
were to come to him after the death of his father, yet he
stuck to his holy orders, continued in his functions, and
upon the translation of Doctor John Lake to the see of
Chichester, was nominated Bishop of Bristol by his Majesty,
(King James the Second, <abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 8, 1685,) whereupon,
after he had been diplomated doctor of divinity, he was
consecrated, November the 8th 1685, in the Archbishop’s
Chapel at Lambeth, and introduced into the House of
Lords with Dr. Ken, Bishop of Bath and Wells, on the
11th day of the same month. On the 8th of June 1688
he was one of the six Bishops, besides Doctor Sancroft the
Archbishop, that were committed prisoners to the Tower of
London, for the alleged offence of contriving, making, and
publishing a seditious libel against his Majesty and his government;
that is for subscribing a petition to his Majesty,
wherein he and the rest of the said Bishops showed the
great averseness that they found in themselves to the distributing
and publishing in all their churches his Majesty’s
late declaration for liberty of conscience, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Where continuing
till they were publicly tried in Westminster Hall
for the same, they were, to the great joy of the true sons of
the Church of England, released thence on the 15th of the
same month. Subsequently, however, the see of Exeter
was conferred on him by King James, vacant by the translation
thence to York of Doctor Lamplugh; and about the
<!--303.png--><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a><span class="pageno">297</span>
7th of April following, his Majesty King William the
Third was pleased to give his royal assent for him, the
said Doctor Jonathan Trelawny, Bishop of Bristol, to be
Bishop of Exeter, in the place of Doctor Lamplugh, beforementioned.</p>

<p>From the Fasti it appears that Jonathan Trelawny, of
Christ Church, was admitted Bachelor of Arts on the 14th
of May 1672, and Master of Arts April the 29th, 1675.
And on October the 26th, 1685, Sir Jonathan Trelawny,
<abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> Master of Arts of Christ Church, the nominated
Bishop of Bristol, was diplomated Doctor of Divinity.</p>

<p>As this gentleman was made Bishop of Bristol by King
James the Second, and after his commitment to the Tower
and acquittal, accepted from him an appointment to the
bishopric of Exeter, almost the last act of that king’s government,
which appointment was almost immediately confirmed
to him by King William on his joining in the Revolution,
one may apply in his case the observation made
by the most philosophical writer of English history, on the
Duke of Marlborough, when he led over Queen Anne to
the Prince of Orange.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“This conduct was a singular sacrifice to public virtue
of every duty in private life, and required for ever after
the most upright, disinterested, and public-spirited behaviour
to render it justifiable.”</p>

<p>He was further advanced by Queen Anne, being again
translated, on the 14th of January 1707, to the see of
Winchester. He died on the 21st of June 1721.</p>

<p>He married Rebecca, daughter and coheiress of Thomas
Hele, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> of Boscome, in Devonshire, and left a numerous
family, but none of his sons left families, and only
two of his daughters; Letitia, who married her cousin
Henry Trelawny; and Rebecca, married to Mr. John
Buller, of Morvall.</p>

<p>Few men ever obtained so great a share of popularity
among all ranks and degrees in his own country as did
the Bishop, when he protested against the insidious declaration
<!--304.png--><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a><span class="pageno">298</span>
of King James the Second, and sustained persecution
in consequence of the support he had given to the Church
of England. Fears were entertained, or apprehensions
were industriously circulated, of extremities never contemplated;
and the prompt acquittal of the Bishops seems
alone to have prevented Cornwall from rising in arms.</p>

<p>A Song was made on the occasion, of which all the exact
words, except those of what may be called the burden, were
lost, but the whole has recently been restored, modernized,
and improved by the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Robert Stephen Hawker, of
Whitstone, near Stratton.</p>

<p>The strong sensation excited throughout England, by
that decisive act of bigotry, tyranny, and imprudence, on
the part of King James the Second, by which he committed
the seven Bishops to the Tower, was in no district
more manifestly displayed than in Cornwall, notwithstanding
the part taken by that county in the Civil War. This
was, probably, in a great degree occasioned by sympathy
with this respected Cornish gentleman, then Bishop of
Bristol. The following Song is said to have resounded in
every house, in every highway, and in every street.</p>

<p>Bishop Trelawny has left at Christ Church a very valuable,
esteemed, and appropriate memorial of himself, and
of the Founder. Over the south-east gate of the great
quadrangle, leading to the staircase of the hall, is a fine
statue of Cardinal Wolsey, with the following inscription:</p>

<p>Edward Trelawny, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> one of the Bishop’s sons, had the
honour of being made Governor of Jamaica; and most
fortunately for the Island, besides many other prudent and
judicious acts, he pacified a formidable body of revolted
negroes, who had long sustained a savage independence,
<!--306.png--><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a><span class="pageno">300</span>
held the fastnesses belonging to the chain of mountains
which divides Jamaica throughout its whole length, and
maintained a predatory war against all the settlers. The
treaty with these people, called Maroons, was in itself so
equitable that it continued to be observed up to the period
when the whirl of political opinions in Europe, mingled
with others of fanatical enthusiasm, extended to these
people, and in consequence they were all either exterminated
or sent to perish in distant countries.</p>

<p>Sir William Trelawny, the sixth <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> great-nephew of
Edward Trelawny, was also Governor of Jamaica, in less
trying times, and the period of his service was cut short by
a premature death in 1772, when the property descended
to his only son, Harry Trelawny, then a boy at school.</p>

<p>The career of this individual, though extraordinary and
eccentric, need not be given in any detail. He appears
to have been a man of naturally a strong understanding,
but having imbibed the spirit of fanaticism in early youth,
it carried him in all directions, as fancy guided, with
equal facility; but in general directly against the consent
of modern opinions, which have repudiated implicit
confidence in traditions, in the decrees of councils, and in
the dicta of ancient fathers, or of popes, substituting in
their place the exercise of private judgment; guided no doubt
in practice by the teacher who happens to carry with him
the fashion of the day.</p>

<p>Sir Harry Trelawny commenced preaching at Westminster
school. He proceeded to Oxford, where in consequence
of nonconformity he could not obtain a degree.
He then took orders in the church of Scotland, and began
a course of preaching in various meeting houses,
especially in one of his own erecting at West Looe. In
the course of a few years, after the novelty had worn away,
he complied with the requisite observances at Oxford and
was admitted to a degree. He then received orders as a
clergyman of the Church of England from Doctor John
Ross, Bishop of Exeter, and soon afterwards the living of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Allan, which he exchanged with his relation Dr. William
<!--307.png--><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a><span class="pageno">301</span>
Buller, the succeeding Bishop, for Egloshayle. This
living he ultimately resigned on becoming a Roman Catholic,
and died in Italy, February the 25th, 1834, having,
as it is said, received the nominal honour from the holy See
of being appointed a Bishop in Partibus Infidelium. He
married Anne, daughter of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> James Brown, of Somersetshire,
and has left a large family.</p>

<p>An event connected with the death of this gentleman,
and which occurred about a year afterwards, roused the
scorn of the whole parish, and of the neighbourhood,
more than any thing that has taken place there within the
memory of the oldest person.</p>

<p>Several priests arrived from the continent, bringing with
them an empty coffin, and the various apparatus used in
Catholic services, when masses were said and requiems
sung at Trelawny for the peace of this individual’s soul,
who had died and was buried in Italy, where it would seem
that these pageants should have been celebrated, on the
double supposition of their being really efficacious, and that
the Almighty is incapable of hearing them from any other
than a single spot. For if the latter supposition were not
admitted, they might as well have been performed in
France, from whence it is apprehended the priests embarked,
unless indeed we suppose of these as of other histriones,
that Μονον αργυρον βλεπουσιν; and in regard to
such a subject, we may fairly go on to add, without want
of charity, Απολοιτο πρωτος αυτος ὁ τον αργυρον φιλησας.</p>

<p>His eldest son, Sir William Lewis Salusbury Trelawny,
married Patience, only daughter of John Phillipps Carpenter,
<abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> of Mount Tavey, near Tavistock, and is now
one of the members in parliament for Cornwall, residing

<p>The manor of Arworthal (which signifies, upon the noted
river,) giving the name of distinction to this parish, and
taking in the greatest part of the lands thereof, I shall begin
with it.</p>

<p>In 3 Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> John Fitz William held half a knight’s fee
in Arworthall, per cartam Edwardi quondam com. Cornub.
dict. feod. Mortan. (Carew, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 126, Lord Dunstanville’s
edition,) which Edward Earl of Cornwall must be Edward
de Caernarvon, afterwards King of England, the <abbr title="second">2d</abbr> of that
name, for there was no other Edward Earl of Cornwall.
<!--309.png--><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a><span class="pageno">303</span>
Elizabeth, the daughter and heir of this Sir John Fitz
William (for he was a knight) brought the manor, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> into
the family of Mohun in which it continued till the reign of
James the 1st, when Sir Reginald Mohun, to raise fortunes
for his children by his third wife, sold this manor to Samuel
Pendarves of Roscrow, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> in whose posterity it yet remaineth,
Mrs. Bassett, the sole heir of that family, being the
present lady thereof.</p>

<p>On the wastrell of this manor have been large quantities
of tin dug up from time to time; and just above the village
of Perran Arworthall, by the pound near Perran Well,
there is a strong chalybeate spring much frequented of late
years.</p>

<p>In this parish did antiently dwell the family of Renaudin,
by their name of French extraction, but where I
cannot positively say; and here dwelt, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Ricardi <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>
David Renaudin, who married Margaret, the eldest daughter
and coheir of James Daungers of Carnclew. John
Renaudin, their son, dying without issue <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Henry <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr>
this estate fell to Richard Bonython of Carclew, who had
married Isabel, the other daughter and coheir of the said
James Daungers, in which family of Bonython (whose
heiress still lays claim to it, and, as by original deeds, it
appears very justly,) it continued to the reign of Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
when Peter Beauchamp of Trevince, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> having a lease
of it for three lives, from John Bonython, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> his posterity
have been strangely outed of the fee ever since; which has
of late years past through several hands, and is now vested
in Thomas Hearle of Penryn, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr></p>

<p>The arms of Renaudin, as painted in the old glass
windows at Carnclew, were Sable, a chevron between three

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.
<!--310.png--><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a><span class="pageno">304</span></p>

<p>This parish, with two others, are dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Perran,
the most distinguished among the missionaries from Ireland,
who converted the Pagan inhabitants of Cornwall to the
Christian faith; but his history properly falls under the head
of Perran Zabuloe, where he fixed his residence and breathed
his last.</p>

<p>The church of Perran Arworthall is very small but neat,
and it is decorated with a tower in due proportion to the
whole fabric. The only ancient village of any consequence
in the whole parish, is called Perran Well, probably from
the chalybeate spring flowing near it; and this village has
imparted its name in common parlance to the whole parish.</p>

<p>Perran Well is situated in a deep valley, having a hill
and a corresponding vale on either side, terminating in the
Carnon branch of Falmouth harbour: over all these the
high road leading from Truro to Falmouth used to pass;
but by a most judicious improvement a causeway has been
laid over Carnon, and these transverse hills and valleys
entirely avoided.</p>

<p>Not far below the village stood one of the tin-smelting
houses constructed after the Germans introduced reverberatory
furnaces; it has been used for the last thirty years
for refining arsenic. This metal and its oxide, most
destructive to animal or to vegetable life, is extensively
useful in metallurgic operations and in the arts. Few substances
are more generally diffused throughout mining
districts: it unites with most other metals, sometimes alone,
but more frequently in union with sulphur, and converts
them into minerals. Metals are therefore said to be mineralized
by arrenic, by sulphur, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> The first operation
used in extracting metals from their ores, is one for driving
off by heat such substances as are volatile. Arsenic is
eminently so: it therefore sublimes, and is deposited in
long flues or chambers made to prevent the destructive
<!--311.png--><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a><span class="pageno">305</span>
consequences of its being diffused through the atmosphere,
and scattered over the country. From these chambers or
flues the refiners of arsenic obtain their supplies, and are
thereby enabled to afford it in a state of purity, at such
prices as would be wholly inadequate for defraying the
expense necessarily to be incurred, if the operation had
commenced on the ores containing this metal in the mines.</p>

<p>Partly in this parish, but principally in Milor, on the
next creek towards Falmouth, are situated the great iron
works, conducted by Messrs. Fox, a family distinguished
for ability, exertion, and liberality, from generation to
generation. These works were the first constructed of any
magnitude in Cornwall. Previously, all the cast-iron materials
for steam engines were brought from Glamorganshire,
and the working of an important mine very frequently
depended on the uncertain direction of the wind; now
every thing that can be required, even cylinders of the
largest dimensions, seven feet and a half (90 <abbr title="inches">in.</abbr>) in diameter,
and ten or twelve feet long, are cast and bored with the
utmost accuracy here and at Hoyle, where similar works
have arisen, to the incalculable benefit of the mining concerns.</p>

<p>The valley above and below these works is perhaps the
most beautiful in the west of Cornwall, and it has recently
been adorned, just opposite the fine woods of Carclew, by
the elegant and tasteful residence of Benjamin Sampson,
<abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> who conducts an extensive manufactory for supplying
the mines with gunpowder made in their immediate neighbourhood.</p>

<p>This parish, and the adjacent one of Stithyans, to which
it is annexed, are believed to have been appropriated to
the religious establishment at Penrey. The impropriation
of the great tithes, and the advowson of the vicarage, have
for a considerable time belonged to the Boscawens of Tregothnan.</p>

of his relations, Mr. Davies father and son, were successive
rectors of this parish, through the bounty of the Trevelyan
family.</p>

<p>And it may be a matter of some curiosity to insert the
oath administered a century ago to clergymen taking on
themselves the office of Dean Rural, or Decanus <a name="err_12" id="err_12"></a>Episcopus.
The oath is now omitted, but the office itself has been
uniformly preserved throughout the Diocese of Exeter, and
this useful institution is revived in various parts of the
kingdom.</p>

<p>The copy was found by the editor at Tredrea, his place
in Cornwall, among other old papers.</p>

<p>Near the church used to flow a well, which, in addition
to supplying ample quantities of excellent water, gave
responses to the most interesting questions respecting life,
deaths, marriages, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> under the superintendence of a
Pythian hierophant (since peeth, pythe, is Cornish for a
well); but this oracle has ceased within the last twenty
years, after a manner fairly appropriate to the county;
the working of a mine having taken away all the water.</p>

<p>There are several good farm houses in the parish, formerly
the residences of gentlemen; but, excepting the
church town, only one place deserving the name of a village,
which is Goldsithney, commonly pronounced Gulzinney,
lying on the road from Redruth to Marazion.
In this village was formerly a chapel dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
<!--315.png--><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a><span class="pageno">309</span>
James, as Doctor Borlase has ascertained from documents
in the cathedral at Exeter. No memory remains of this
chapel having ever been used for divine service; but within
the editor’s recollection a small image might be seen over
the door, said by the inhabitants to be <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Perran; but if
the records consulted by Doctor Borlase are correct, more
probably of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons mentions the fair which is annually holden
here on the fifth of August, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James’s day, by the old
style; and he also takes notice of a tale, which the editor
has heard a thousand times, of the fair having been originally
kept in the church town of Sithney, near Helston, by virtue
of a glove, which was annually displayed there, till the
men of Perran, by force or cunning, or by proposing to
exchange new gloves for old ones, bore off the talisman,
and have by its authority held the fair at Goldsithney ever
since, paying one shilling every year as a poor compensation
to the party bereaved.</p>

<p>It is needless to add that this tale, as it is related, cannot
be true; but the names Sithney and Goldsithney, with the
payment to the churchwardens of the parish, seem to indicate
some relation between the parish and this village.
The displaying of a glove at fairs is an ancient and widely
extended custom. Mr. Lysons says it is continued at
Chester. The editor has seen a large ornamented glove
displayed on a lofty pole over the Guild Hall at Exeter,
during the fairs. Was the glove used to receive the tolls,
as shillings are still collected in some courts of justice; or
had it any reference to hand payments on delivery, as is
usual in fairs; or has it a more noble origin in chivalry?</p>

<p>A cove is pointed out in Perran, where the ancestor of
the Trevelyans is said to have been borne on shore by the
strength of his horse, from the destruction of the Lionesse
country, west of the Land’s End. The Trevelyan family
are too old, too honourable, and now too much distinguished
by science, for them to covet any addition of honour
through the medium of fabulous history.</p>

<p>It is recorded in the Saxon Chronicle, that in the year
<!--316.png--><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a><span class="pageno">310</span>
1099, on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s day, there was so very high a tide,
and the damage so great in consequence, that men remembered
not the like to have ever happened before, and the
same day was the first of the new moon.</p>

<p>Stow, who wrote his History of England about the year
1580, notices the great tide of 1099, when he says, The
sea brake in over the banks of the Thames and other ryvers,
drowning many towns, and much people, with innumerable
numbers of oxen and sheepe; at which time the lands in
Kent, that sometime belonged to Duke Godwyne, Earle of
Kent, were covered with sandes and drowned, which are to
this day called Godwyne Sandes. On the slender foundation
of these alluvial catastrophies, Florence of Worcester
either invented, or with more than monkish credulity,
received the tale of a whole district being ingulphed; not
at some remote geological period, but in what may be considered
as the recent times of authentic history, after the
existence of systematic registers and records; a district,
covered as he states, by a city, and by a hundred and forty
churches, with their accompanying villages, farms, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> an
event that must have shaken the whole of Europe: and, to
increase the wonder, a gentleman accidentally on horseback,
is carried by this animal to the neighbouring shore of Whitsend
Bay, or twenty miles further off, to Perran, through a
sea which had swallowed an entire country, and from which
the largest of modern vessels could not by possibility have
escaped. This idle tale, related by one writer after another,
has almost reached our own times. The editor remembers
a female relation of a former vicar of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Erth, who, instructed
by a dream, prepared decoctions of various herbs,
and repairing to the Land’s End, poured them into the
sea, with certain incantations, expecting to see the Lionesse
country rise immediately out of the water, having all its
inhabitants alive, notwithstanding their long submersion.

events and of tales exciting the passions, seems not to
have diminished in recent times, yet the editor is unaware
of any subsequent attempt having been made to rescue those
unfortunate people from their protracted state of suspended
animation.</p>

<p>Perran Uthnow has to boast of but one modern addition
to its residences. About the year 1775, the late Mr. John
Shakspeare of Pendarves, built a house similar to the one
previously erected by Mr. Stephens at Tregorne, and gave
it the name of the family with which he was connected by
his marriage.</p>

<p>About half a mile beyond this house, called Acton Castle,
Cudden Point projects into the sea, entirely covered
with rock, and affording, in many respects, the most pleasing
view of any spot in the whole Bay. From <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s
Mount itself, the feature transcendent above all others is
lost; but from Cudden all the western objects are seen,
without including the long flat land of the Lizard.</p>

<p>Children from all the neighbourhood are in the habit
of going to Cudden Point at the low water of spring tides,
with the hope of finding a silver table, although they know
not why. It appears, however, that a Spanish vessel, having
much bullion on board, was wrecked there in the reign
of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The addition of Uthno made to this saint’s name, designates
a manor within the parish; there is also a manor
called Lan Uthno, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Erth, distinguished in former
times as the parish of Lan Uthno; but the editor has
never been able to form any conjecture respecting the
meaning or the etymology of this word.</p>

<p>The parish feast is celebrated on the nearest Sunday to
the fifth of March, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Perran’s Day.</p>

<p>This parish measures 924 statute acres.</p>

<!--318.png--><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a><span class="pageno">312</span>

<p>This great increase of Population is owing to Perran
having become a mining parish, and to the cultivation of
an extensive piece of waste ground by individuals, constructing
houses on portions of land not exceeding one or two
acres, granted on leases for their lives. A spot on this formerly
open ground, was called Chapel an Crouse, the
chapel and cross; but no record nor trace remains of
any such an establishment. Near the same place a bowling
green existed about fifty years ago, which is said to have
been frequented fifty years prior to that period, by all the
gentlemen of the neighbourhood.</p>

days together, with no more than three cows, as also bringing
to life dead hogs and dead men. It seems those kings
were not very grateful to him, for he was forced (as the
same tradition saith) to swim over from Ireland hither on a
millstone. And saith Mr. Carew (<abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 58), if my author,
the legend, lie not, after that (like another Johannes de
Temporibus) he had lived two hundred and six years with
perfect health, [he] took his last rest in a Cornish parish,
(<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> this) which therethrough he endowed with his name.
He is also looked upon as the patron of the Tinners, who
keep his feast on the 5th of March, and tell twenty idle
stories of him, much derogating from his sanctity. Note,
that on that day, 5th of March, there is a fair held near
the church, the profit of which belongs to the parish.</p>

<p>This church is a vicarage, and valued, together with <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>

<p>All the lands in this parish, except the manor of Penhall
and Halwyn, are either part of or held from the manors of
Tywarnhaile and Tywarnhaile Tiers. I shall, therefore,
first treat of these two manors, and then of the other most
memorable places, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>The manor of Tywarnhaile is so called from the situation
of the once principal place in it, and signifies a house on a
river of salt water, it being seated on the west side of
Piran Bay, on a small river to which the tide cometh every
day.</p>

<p>This, and the manor of Tywarnhaile Tiers, were originally
but one manor; and the toll of tin is still amain
between them, though all the lands are divided, and the
<!--320.png--><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a><span class="pageno">314</span>
toll of all other metals goes with the lands and owners of the
several divisions; but the royalty is amain, and they both
hold courts cum visu franci plegii, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p class="p2 center smaller">THE MANOR OF TYWARNHAILE TIERS.</p>

<p>Sir Henry le Tyes, Lord Tyes, or (as Mr. Camden calls
him) de Tiers, was lord of the manor.</p>

<p>Not far from Tywarnhaile house is a small island, upon
which are the ruins of a chapel, called Chapel Angarder.</p>

<p>The manor of Penwortha, alias Penwartha, I take to
signify the higher head or hill, according to its situation in
regard to the places adjacent.</p>

<p>The ancient lords of this manor were the Pentires of
Pentire in Minvor, and of Pentewan in Mevagissey; the
last of whom, Philip Pentire, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> left one daughter and
heir, Jane, married to Thomas Roscarrock, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> which
Jane died possessed of this manor, 5 <abbr title="James One">Jac. I.</abbr> 1607 (rent of
Tywarnhaile-Tiers, penes me Thomas Tonkin). In Penwortha
village is an old chapel still standing, but profaned.
This manor is held from that of Tywarnhaile-Tiers, at
£1. 2<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> rent yearly.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Roscarrock, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> sold this manor in 16 <abbr title="Charles One">Car. I.</abbr> to
Sir Francis Vyvyan of Trelowarren, <abbr title="knight">knt.</abbr> in whose posterity
it still continueth, Sir Francis Vyvyan, <abbr title="baronet">bart.</abbr> being the
present lord thereof.</p>

<p>There have been small parcels of tin discovered in the
north-west parts of this manor, as also a vein of lead some
few years since, between the village of Penwortha and
Lambrigan; but neither have turned to any account.</p>

<p>Lambourne-Wigan, vulgo Lambrigan, is adjoining to
Penwortha, and commonly called by abbreviation Lambrigan.
The meaning of Lambourn is Lam or Lan, an
inclosure, and Wigan, the same as Vycan, Vean, little; the
little Lambourn, to distinguish it from the other. This
estate is likewise held from the manor of Tywarnhaile-Tyes,
and has passed through the same hands as the manor
<!--321.png--><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a><span class="pageno">315</span>
of Penwortha, for two-thirds of it, of which Sir Francis
Vyvyan is now lord.</p>

<p>The other third, commonly called the Lower Town,
one Bartholomew de Trewenethick (Trenethick in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Agnes) did possess one half of, in the 21st of Richard
<abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>; which, together with Trevanythick, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> he settled on
Joan, his daughter and heir, and John Hayme: which, by
their grand-daughter and heir, came to Luke Beauchamp
of Chyton, and was, I suppose, sold by Peter Beauchamp,
to the ancestor of Francis Gregor of Trewarthenick, who
now possesseth it.</p>

<p>The other sixth, or half of the said third, came through
several hands, which I have not been able to get a true
account of, to one Thomas Carter, of Dartmouth in Devon,
and he sold it 22 <abbr title="Charles One">Car. I.</abbr> to John Tregea of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes, who
haxing acquired a pretty estate by tin, and taken a lease of
Vyvyan’s two thirds, and Gregor’s sixth, settled himself
here, and began to build upon it; but, dying soon after, he
left it to finish to his son, Captain William Tregea; who
having married Mary, the daughter of Richard Cross of
Bromfield, in Somerset, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> by whom he had no surviving
issue, he soon after her death run out a handsome estate,
partly left him by his father, and partly of his own acquiring;
and in 1694 sold his right in this barton to Michael
Tonkin of Penwenick, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr>; after which he went into the
army, and was some time a captain in the late Lord Mohun’s
regiment. He died in London or near it in 1730, and
gave for his arms, Azure, three boar’s heads couped Argent.
Michael Tonkin parted with it again in 1702, to the writer
hereof, who had settled himself here on his marriage in
1699, where he lived during his father’s life, being as pleasant
a seat as any in those parts, especially for all country
exercises of hunting, fishing, and fowling, the fine downs
round it, and the moors under, abounding in game.</p>

<p class="p2 center smaller">THE MANOR OF LAMBOURN.
<!--322.png--><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a><span class="pageno">316</span></p>

<p>To the east of Lambrigan and contiguous, is Lambourn,
which gives name to this lordship, and which is held partly
from Tywarnhaile, and partly from Tywarnhaile Tyes. I
take the name to be a softening of <span class="title">Lan Bron</span>, the hill inclosure,
and so it is written in old deeds, and the situation
agrees with it.</p>

<p>This was the seat, and gave name to a considerable and
knightly family. Sir John de Lambron, <abbr title="tempore Henry Three">temp. Hen. III.</abbr>
(Exeter Reg.) gave Caerkief, in this parish, to the Dean
and Chapter of Exeter, and they still enjoy it. John de
Lambron (Carew, <abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 51) was one of the men ad arma, 17
<abbr title="Edward Two">Edw. II.</abbr> Sir John de Lambron, (idem, <abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 52) I suppose
his son, was one of those who had £20 lands of rents
or more, in the county of Cornwall, 25 <abbr title="Edward Three">Edw. III.</abbr> (as the
former John is certified to have had £40); and was summoned
to attend the King at London, the next Sunday
after the Octave of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John the Baptist, and to go with
him in the parts beyond sea. The next that I meet with,
and the last of his family, was William Lamborn (Heralds’
Office) who had only one daughter and heir, married <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr>
Henry <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> to Sir John Arundell of Lanhearne, and called
Amara, who brought the whole estate into that family.
Their arms were, Argent, a fess between two chevrons
Sable.</p>

<p>Sir John Arundell gave this manor, inter alia, to their
third son Sir Renfry Arundell; who, by Joan the daughter
and heir of Sir John Colshull, knight, (killed at the
battle of Agincourt, <abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr> 25, 1415,) had one son, Renfry,
and one daughter, Elizabeth, married: 1. to William
Whittington, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>; 2. to Edmund Stradling, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> Renfry
Arundell had only one son, Sir Edmund Arundell,
knight, who died without issue, leaving his aunt Elizabeth
his heir; who, by her second husband Edmund Stradling,
had only one daughter, Ann, married to Sir John Danvers,
knight. Between whom, and her eldest son (by her first
<!--323.png--><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a><span class="pageno">317</span>
husband) John Whittington, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> she divided her large
estate, no less than thirteen good manors of land.</p>

<p>This manor, by this division, falling into two hands, the
mansion house fell by degrees into decay, the stones of it
were employed to build several mean houses for tenants (for
it is now a village), and nothing remains but the chapel
dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Edmund, now too turned to a dwelling,
and part of the wall of the chapel yard, now a garden, but
formerly a burying place. There was likewise in it lately
a font. From all which I gather, it was a place of public
worship, perhaps sometimes served by the vicar (on
account of the said donation of Caerkief), by reason of its
great distance from the church, being at least three miles.
[Caerkief was probably given by the Lambrons, for leave
to erect this chapel, which appears to have been a chapel
of ease to the parish church, but was erected for the use of
the Lambrons, their servants, and their tenants.] Thomas
Whittington, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> grandson of William Whittington, and
Elizabeth Arundell, died 38 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> (Dugdale’s Warwickshire,
page 619), leaving six daughters and coheiresses,
whereof Blanche, the youngest, became the wife of John
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubin of Clewance, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>; and some of them, though
all married, dying without issue, her posterity became
intituled to one fifth and one sixtieth of all the Cornish
lands; and this part of this manor is in the possession of
Sir John <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn, <abbr title="baronet">bart.</abbr> The remaining part of Whittington’s
moiety, was sold by the other coheirs to &mdash;&mdash;
Davy of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cuthbert, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> whose posterity enjoyed it till
the latter end of the reign of Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> when Davy sold
his part to Humphry Borlace, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>, and this went with a
great part of his estate (as you may see in Newlin) to Sir
William Scawen, knight, whose nephew, Thomas Scawen,
is now lord thereof.</p>

<p>Danvers his moiety continued in his family till Queen
Elizabeth’s time, when Sir John Danvers of Dantesey in
Wiltshire, knight, dismembered and sold it in several
parcels:&mdash;<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> 18 Elizabeth, 1577, one half of a tenement
<!--324.png--><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a><span class="pageno">318</span>
(in which is <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Edmund’s chapel, and computed at one
sixth of the whole township of Lambourn,) to John Trevellans,
alias Nicholas, alias Williams; whose son, Nicholas
Williams, alias Trevellans, sold it, 13 <abbr title="James One">Jac. I.</abbr> to James
Jenkyn Trekynin, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> from whose heirs it is come at last
to Thomas Oats, and the writer thereof. Another part of
a tenement, being one fourth of the town of Lambourne,
[was sold by Sir John Danvers] much about the same
time to &mdash;&mdash; Oats, whose son John Oats sold it to the
ancestor of Francis Gregor of Trewarthenick, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> who
now enjoys it; and the remaining one twelfth part (which
maketh up his half of the said town), together with all his
claim to the one half of the lordship of Lambourne, and its
appurtenances, (Aut penes Authorem) to Edward Arundell
of Lanherne, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> (being a younger brother of that family)
19 Elizabeth, 1577-8, whose son, Thomas Arundell of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Columb Major, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> settled the same, inter alia, 24 <abbr title="Charles">Car.</abbr> <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>

one fourth, Thomas Tonkin, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> one sixth, and Thomas
Oats, one eighteenth. Where note that the said Thomas
Oats, a wealthy farmer in the said village, (great-grandson
to John Oats, who owned one fourth, now Mr. Gregor’s,)
I have reason to think (Aut. penes Authorem, at orig. pen.
Thomas Oats) descended from Otho Trefusis, who released
his right in villa de Trelisick (in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Earth) to John Cornwall,
7 Junii, 28 Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>; from which Otho or Oats his
posterity took the name of Oats, as was then very common
to do; and have, therefore, in my map of the hundred of
Pider, set the arms of Trefusis (which I think he may lawfully
give) over his name.</p>

The said Richard Bluet and Elizabeth his wife, soon
after, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> 30 Maii, 1650, sold the half of this manor, and
what remained indisposed of, which was only one half of
Millinoweth, alias Vellonnoweth [the New Mill], and
Nampetha, with Goynlase in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes, and a small part
in Fenton Vease [the outward well] and Collrun in this
parish, with a few high rents, unto Walter Vincent of Trigowethan,
<abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>; which, as the rest of the Vincent’s estates,
is gone (as you may see in Mevagissey) to John Knight,
who, Sir John <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubin, and Thomas Scawen, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> are the
present lords of this manor.</p>

<p>In the commons belonging to the town of Lambourn, is a
Barrow, called <span class="title">Creeg Mear</span>, the Great Burrow, which one
Christopher Michell digging into some years since, whilst
I lived at Lambrigan, in hopes to find stones for an
adjoining hedge of his, came to an hollow place (as usual
in such), and found nine urns full of ashes; which, being
disappointed of what he sought for, for the barrow was all
of earth, except three or four rough stones which formed
the hollow, he brutally broke immediately to pieces; and
when I expostulated with him about it, and told him I
would have paid him his charges, his reply was, that whenever
he met with any more, he would bring them to me,
but these were a parcel of old pitchers good for nothing.
That these were Danish, I believe there is no doubt. [They
were British, as appears at once, from the <span class="title">Kist Vaen</span>
discovered within, and from the hinted badness of the
pottery.] But they were, I suppose, the ashes of some
chief commanders slain in battle, (for which the place is
very fit, it being a large open down) from the great number
of them. [One barrow cannot mark a battle.] And
on a small hill just under this barrow, [and, as under the
barrow, bearing probably no relation to it,] is a Danish
encampment, called Castle Caer Dane, vulgo Castle Caer
Don, i. e. the Danes’ Camp, consisting of three intrenchments
finished, and another begun with an intent to surround
the inner three, but not completed; the whole containing
<!--326.png--><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a><span class="pageno">320</span>
about &mdash;&mdash; acres. And opposite to this, about a
bowshot, the river only running between, on another hill,
is another camp or castle, called Castle Kaerkief, castrum
simile, from Kyfel, similis, alike, alluding to Castle Caerdane.
But this is but just begun, and not finished in any
part; from whence I guess, that there were too different
parties, of which the first attacked the other, before they
could finish their intrenchments: or perhaps these attacked
the first, having only thrown up a few intrenchments for
the present, on which a battle ensuing, these were the
ashes of the chief men that fell in it. And this being
called Creeg Mear, the Great Barrow, seems to carry a more
special regard with it. This Castle Caerkief is on the
estate which the forementioned Sir John de Lambron gave
to the church at Exeter, and no doubt had its name from
this fortification.</p>

<p>[These opposed camps have no other pretence to a
Danish origin, than what a Cornish critic should be
ashamed to own, the mere coincidence in sound of Din or
Dines with Danish. This is the sole foundation for all the
Danish camps, with which the antiquarian oscitancy of
Cornwall has replenished the county. All built upon hills,
they naturally take the name of Din, Dinas, or Don, in
Cornish, to denote their site; and while the common people,
unseduced by the surmises of literature, still retain the
name in its original purity, the scholars come forward and
mould it to their own follies. We see this very livelily in
the name of the former of these two camps, which the common
people call Caer <em>Don</em>, but the critic writes it Caer
<em>Dane</em>, and then interprets into the Danes’ camp, but it
signifies only the hill fortress. Opposed to this, on another
hill, and beyond a rivulet, is another camp, which is called
Caerkief, the companion or mate of the other. Kyfel, says
Mr. Tonkin, signifying similar or like in Cornish, Kyvedk
(C.) being a fellow, or colleague, Kyvadhas (C.) a companion,
and Kuf (C.) a wife, Cyfaill, Cyfailt (W.) a friend,
a companion, and Cyfalle, (W.) a husband or wife, a partner,
<!--327.png--><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a><span class="pageno">321</span>
a fit match. The very opposition of the camps is thus
denoted in the name. But then Caer Don is considered
as the principal, and Caer Kief has its appellation from its
relation to that. They are a British and a Roman camp.
The Roman appears from the smallness, lying “on a small
hill,” from the finished state of its intrenchments, from its
having no less than three, and from its having even a fourth
begun, to encircle all. These marks of military attention
and of patient industry, all unite to point it out decisively
for a Roman one. Nor has the other a signature less lively
of its British origin; it is “but just begun, and not finished
in any part.” The Romans, probably seeing the Britons
begin to fortify their ground, desisted from their fourth
work, marched out of their own camp, and attacked the
Britons in theirs, before they could form it; and in this
view of the camps, the barrow, which is over the Roman,
and not between it and the British, could have no reference
to either, and was only the tomb of some family residing in
the vale below. <span class="sc">Whitaker.</span>]</p>

<p>Next to Lambourne, and within the manor, which extends
itself over several parishes, (Treluddro in Newlyn
being held from it) is a great village called Callestock
Veor, or the Great Callestock, to distinguish it from another
in this parish, which is by interpretation hard broad
oak, (though stock properly signifies the stem or stock of a
tree,) which formerly grew here in great abundance, though
there are now but few remaining. Here lately lived a
younger branch of the Tebbots, vulgo Tippets, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Wen;
the last of which, John Tippet, had an estate of £100 per
annum, partly fee, partly lease, which he chiefly spent in
law, and was in his old age, more than 90, maintained by
the parish: he died about 1712. As likewise, as appears by
the confirmed rate 1612, one Mr. Torr; but I can at present
say no more of him for want of better information.</p>

<p>There are in the commons of this village some remaining
intrenchments, but not worthy of notice. But at a place, also
within this manor, about three quarters of a mile from it,
<!--328.png--><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a><span class="pageno">322</span>
called <span class="title">Tresawsen</span>, alias <span class="title">Bosawsen</span>, i. e. the English town
or dwelling, on the top of the hill to the south of the village,
is a double Danish intrenchment, of which the outer one
has been almost filled up by often ploughing, but the inner
one is very entire, and they both contain about an acre of
land. It hath no particular name that I know of, but is
within sight of Castle Caer Dane, from which it is distant
about two miles. And from this you see another in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Allen, about the same distance from this; vide <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Allen.
[Tresawen, alias Bosawsen, from Tre and Boss (C.) a house,
and Saisson, Saxon, or English, is evidently from its name,
not Danish, but Saxon. It is a Saxon fort, constructed
on the reduction of the West of Cornwall by Athelstan,
and maintained as a bridle and a curb upon the natives;
and it seems to mark the advance of the Saxon arms from
Camelford, where Egbert gained his great victory over the
Cornish, to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Burien’s, from which Athelstan probably
embarked for, and at which he certainly landed on his
return from reducing the Scilly Isles.]</p>

<p>Having taken notice of the most remarkable things in
this manor (for I have spoken of the three barrows and four
barrows in Kenwin, only I forgot to mention, that in
the middle of Callestock stood a chapel, of which the
very ruins are now scarce visible; and that in Caerkief,
near the highway to Mitchell, is a fair arched well called
Fenton Berran, i. e. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Piran’s Well,) I come next to</p>

<p>The Manor of Fenton Gymps, which takes its name from
its capital place, Fenton Gymps Veor, or the Great Fenton
Gymps; which adjunct, Gymps, is a contraction of
<em>Thesympes</em>, not intermitting, [and means] the well that
always flows, as not freezing in winter, or dying [drying]
in the summer. And such a one there is in the town place
of the manor house. [The aim of the etymon is very right
here, I believe; but the manner in which it is directed is
wrong. Adjoined to the word Fenton, and explained by
the existing reality, <em>Gymps</em> assuredly means what Mr.
Tonkin says, not intermitting, but always flowing. But
<!--329.png--><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a><span class="pageno">323</span>
how does <em>Gymps</em> signify this? That it is a contraction of
<em>thesympes</em> can hardly be allowed. The contraction is too
violent. <em>Thesympes</em> also signifies nothing but <em>immediately</em>
in Borlase, which can have no association with the general
idea. Whence then shall we derive the word? We have
it without any derivation, and without any contraction, in
Kympez (C.) always. And Dr. Pryce I since find so
derives the word.] This gave name to an ancient race of
gentlemen. John de Fentongemps (Aut. pen. Author.)
lived here 21 Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> [Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>] 1346. John Fentongymps,
“D’nus et hæres de Fentongympys,” grants to
John, the son of Ralph de Fentongympys, all his messuages
lands, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> in Fentongympis, and elsewhere, in the county
of Cornwall; dated the Feast of the Purification, 12 Henry
<abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> John Fentongemps of the parish of Pirran in Treth
(the sand) grants to John, the son of Thomas Martin, a
lease for term of years of Marghessen-foos (Marasan vose)
in the said parish, dated at Marghessen-foos, in festo Petri
et Pauli, 3 Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr></p>

<p>Note. That Marghessen-foos, or Marasan-vose, i. e. the
Maids’ Market, is a village in the manor of Fenton-gymps
in Piran sands, but why so named I cannot guess, except
that, being in the great road to Mitchell, the maids came
there to offer themselves in service, a custom taken notice
of, particularly by Dr. Plot, <abbr title="Natural History of Oxfordshire, chapter">Nat. Hist. of Oxf. c.</abbr> 8, 29, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr>
208; but not (that I know of) practised now anywhere in
this county. [Mr. Tonkin has here misled himself by an
etymon forced and false. He considers foos or vose as
Môz a maid. But the name is merely this, Marghes or
Marhas an Fôs or Vôs, the market on the ditch or trench.
Fos, indeed, Borlase interprets wall, and has this very
appellation, Marhas an Fôs, which he renders the market
on wall, obviously without any sense. But under Vôs he
recollects himself&mdash;“Vôs for fôs;” he then says, “a ditch,
wall, or fence,” as Penvôs, head of the trench, <em>Marhas an
Vos, the market on the foss</em>.” Dr. Pryce adopts both these
etymons in his vocabulary, and prefers the former in his
<!--330.png--><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a><span class="pageno">324</span>
names very injudiciously. From this name the village
appears to have been formerly a market town. The
market was perhaps held on some boundary ditch, and
took its name from it; but in all probability, as “being
in the great road to Mitchell,” it lay upon a Roman road,
which, like the great road from Lincolnshire to Bath, and
through Somersetshire to the south or west, bore the appellation
of foss; and very probably the Foss itself is continued
by Stratton, Camelford, Wadebridge, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Columb,
direct by Newlyn into Piran parish, Lamburn, Lambrigan,
Marghessan-fos, and White Street there. See the map in
Borlase. <span class="sc">Whitaker.</span>]</p>

<p>William Pennalyky releases to John Fyntengympys all
his claim, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> in Fyntengympys Veor, Fyntengympys
Vyan [little Fyntengympys], Marhasen-fos, Rekellythye,
Chyendur, Paddestock, and Chywarton, “dat. apud Truro
Burg. 14 Julii, 24 Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>” Which John Fentongympys
had (I suppose) only one daughter and heir, Joan
(for so she is said to be in a deed from John Laurens, cler.
and Edmund Santy, capell.), to her of a tenement in Fentongympys
Vyan, and the heirs which Benedict, the son of
John Bernard of Bodmyn, has or shall beget on the body
of the said Joan, “dat. apud Truru Burgh,” the day before
the feast of Bartholomew, 24 <abbr title="Henry Six">Hen. VI.</abbr> Which Joan, I
guess, by a deed bearing date 8 Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> was afterwards
married to John Penrose, in which he and Richard Penrose
(I suppose his second son) release to William Penrose,
his son and heir, and Isabel, the daughter and heir of John
Hayme, an annuity of twenty shillings, lately granted to
them by the said William, and issuing out of Fentengympys
Veor, Fentengympys Bian, Chyandouer, Marghassan-fos,
and Chywarton. The next that I find possessed of any
right here, are Richard Penwarne, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> and William
Wayte of Trewenethick, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> Wayte sells his part to
Henry Dotson of Roskymer in Mawgan Meneg, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr>
(which said Henry had an estate before in Fentongymps,
<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> but by what right it doth not appear,) the 4th and 5th
<!--331.png--><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a><span class="pageno">325</span>
of Philip and Mary 1558; by which means Penwarne and
Dotson had each a moiety of this manor. Sir John Arundell
of Tolverne, knight, John Dotson of Reskymer, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr>
(whose trustee I take Arundell to have been<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_10" id="fnanchor_10"></a><a href="#footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span>) convey their
half to John Code of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Wen, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> 20 <abbr title="September">9<sup>ber</sup></abbr>, 31 Elizabeth.</p>

<p>John Code and his brethren sell the same, 10 <abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr> 40
<abbr title="Elizabeth">Eliz.</abbr> to John Carter of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Columb Major, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> Richard
Penwarne of Penwarne in Mawnan, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> sells the other
half to the said John Carter, 20 <abbr title="January">Jan.</abbr> 38 <abbr title="Elizabeth">Eliz.</abbr></p>

<p>In which family of Carter this manor continued till
165&mdash;; when his grandson, Richard Carter, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> sold it to
John Cleather, senior, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> whose posterity lived here some
time in good repute. And in the year 1691, his grandson
Samuel Cleather, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> together with some lands in the
manor of Lambourn, sold it for £1500, to Hugh Tonkin,
<abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> and the writer hereof is at present lord of it. Mr.
Cleather gave, in a field Vert, a chevron Or, between three
clethes (swords in Cornish,) the blades Proper, the pommels
of the Second.</p>

<p>Within this manor is Chywarton (vulgo Chyton) i. e. a
house on a hill. [Tshei, Chi, a house in Cornish, War
upon, and Don, a hill.] This was the seat in lease (though
John Resogan, senior, bought the fee about the year 169&mdash;,
of the heirs of John Lord Arundell of Trerice) of a branch
of the Resogans, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s in Brannel. Here lived
in Queen Elizabeth’s time, Bennet Resogan, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr></p>

<p>But this and a pretty little estate, in all about £100 per
annum, was consumed by a dependant of his, John Resogan,
jun. who lived at an estate called Callestock-Ruol, i. e.
Cullistock always adjoining to this. [This etymon is so
unmeaning that the mind rejects it at once. A good one
also presents itself. Ruy (C.) is a prince or king, and
Ryel (C.) is royal. The adjunct, therefore, denotes the
mansion to be royal, or one of the many mansions which
<!--332.png--><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a><span class="pageno">326</span>
the Kings of Cornwall had upon their demesnes.] Chyton
he sold to John Andrew of Trevellance in this parish, in
the year 1724.</p>

<p>I must go backwards now, and come to the manor of
Trevellance, alias Pencaranowe, id est, Pen-Carnow, the
hill of rocks.</p>

<p>Trevellance, i. e. the dwelling in the Mill Valley (alluding
to Mellingy Mill in its neighbourhood, from whence
another estate under the said mill is called Nancemellin,
i. e. to the mill valley.) [N.B. Mr. Tonkin apparently
forms Trevellance of Tre Melin Nance, three words that
could never by any contraction be shrunk within the compass
of it. The name appears below to be Trefelens; and
Trevelin is the house of the mill.] was the dwelling house of
Mr. William Trefelens (so writ by the error [when it
appears below to be no error] of the scribe) which, 12
Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> he settled by the name of Trefelens, Penkaranowe,
Trevelles, Polleowe, Coysgarne, the rights and services
in Nampara, and the rents and services in Runewartha,
on Ralph John, cler.</p>

<p>He sold it to William Tregea of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes; who in
16…, was forced to sell it to pay his debts, to John Thomas
in 1694; whose father &mdash;&mdash; Thomas, was of the
Thomases [a later hand has added, of Glamorganshire in
Wales; he was the younger son of Howel Thomas of Glamorganshire,
by &mdash;&mdash; the daughter of Sir Robert Burt
of Pembrokeshire]; whose son John Thomas, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> [he
died in 1733, and his son Andrew Thomas, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> hath the
whole estate,] having married Jane, [in a later hand Anne,]
the only surviving daughter and heir of Mr. John Andrew
of Trewellance, will, after his decease, have in conjunction
with his own, a pretty estate in this parish. Mr. Thomas’s
arms are [N.B. in a later hand, Gules, a chevron and
canton Ermine.]</p>

<p>To the east of Penkaranowe, and joining with it, is
Reenwartha, the higher hill, to distinguish it from another
<!--333.png--><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a><span class="pageno">327</span>
called Reen Wollas, the Lower Hill [Rhyn (W.) a mountain
or promontory, Ryn (C.) a bill, a nose, Rynen (C.) a
hillock. Penryn in Cornwall, a projecting hill on which
the town of that name is built, and Penrhyn, the most
common word in Wales for a promontory; Wartha (C.)
on high, above; and Wollos, Wolas (C.) below.] Between
which two Penkaranowe lies. This was sold by the
said R. Haweis to Cottey, whose grandson, Christopher
Cottey, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> now enjoys it; but one fifth part of it distinct
from the other, as also one fifth part of Hendrawna and
Nampara (all within the manor) were the lands of inheritance
of Hugh Jackman, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr>; and by him sold about the
year 1670, to Walter Vincent of Truro, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> who (Aut.
pen. Author.) <abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 22, 1678, conveyed them to John Catcher
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clement’s, reserving to himself the tin and
royalty. From Catcher they came to Henry Gregor of
Truro, merchant, whose grandson, Samuel Ennys, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>
now enjoys them.</p>

<p>After the said Reginald Haweis had dismembered it
thus, he sold the lordship and the little that was left, one
fifth of Trevelles in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes, and some trifle more, to
the said Walter Vincent, which is gone, with the rest of
the estate, to Mr. Knight.</p>

<p>This manor, and the several estates therein, are held
partly from Tywarnhaile, and partly from Tywarnhaile
Tiers.</p>

<p>Note, that between Reen Wollas and Trevellance runs
a fine rivulet, which in the winter season overflowing its
banks, and making the passage over it very dangerous,
occasioned a county bridge of two arches of stone, and a
long causeway, with a smaller arch at the eastern end of it,
to be constructed in 1708, chiefly procured by the writer
hereof (several people having been drowned here, it being
a great thoroughfare), who was at the general sessions
appointed treasurer for the building it; this is called Melingybridge,
from the adjacent village of Melingay, i. e. the
mill in the river [that is, the water mill,] under which are
<!--334.png--><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a><span class="pageno">328</span>
fine moors for fowling and fishing, abounding with all sorts
of wild fowls, and peal, salmon, shots, eels, and flounders.</p>

<p class="p2 center smaller">THE MANOR OF <abbr title="Saint">ST.</abbr> PIRAN</p>

<p>Lyeth joining to the east, with Penkaranowe and Reen
Wartha between them, and the church lands of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Piran,
from whom it takes its name.</p>

<p>This is now wholly destroyed by the sands, but was once
the seat of a family of the same name: by a daughter of
one of which it came to the Rendalls of Pelint; and by
Elizabeth, the only daughter and heir of Walter Rendall
of Lostwithiel, to her husband, Henry Vincent of Tresimple,
whose son Walter Vincent, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> claimed a free warren
here under the Duke of Cornwall. It hath some good tin
works in it, but so chargeable, by reason of the depth of
sand, that they do not turn to much account, and are gone
with the rest of the estate as above. This manor is in
Carew, <abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 46, rated at three acres Cornish, 12 Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr></p>

<p>At the back side of this manor, to the south, is a large
down or wastrell.</p>

<p>[N. B. here a page 460 e. is lost; and since I saw it last,
I think. But from the marginal note, “Piran Round,” it
contained a description of that Cornish amphitheatre.]</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>It is rather a curious circumstance that the word Zabuloe
added to Perran, for the distinction of this parish, is not
derived from the Celtic, but through the French sable
from sabulum, a word frequently used by Pliny as indicative
of sand or gravel.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, some leaves are wanting from Mr. Tonkin’s
manuscript of this parish, so that no account is found in
it, either of the amphitheatre, or of the consecrated well
which belongs to Perran Zabuloe; although, by a singular
anomaly, the Perran in Kerrier bears the name as an
<!--335.png--><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a><span class="pageno">329</span>
addition, at least in common parlance. Doctor Borlase
has given a description and a plan of this curious Round,
as it is usually called, in his work on the Natural History
of Cornwall, printed at Oxford in 1758, where, at <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 298,
he says:&mdash;“The area of the amphitheatre is perfectly level,
and about one hundred and thirty feet in diameter. The
benches, seven in number, rise eight feet from the area.
The top of the rampart is seven feet wide; it slopes externally
into a foss, which rises by another slope to the level
of the country. There is a circular pit nearly in the centre,
thirteen feet in diameter, and three feet deep, the sides
also sloping. Half way down is a bench of turf, so formed
as to reduce the bottom to an ellipsis; and a shallow trench
four feet six inches wide, and one foot deep, runs in an
easterly direction to the nearest part of the circle, where it
terminates in a semi-oval cavity extending eleven feet from
north to south, and nine feet from east to west, making a
breach in the benches.”</p>

<p>This and other similar works in Cornwall, are believed
to have accommodated great numbers of spectators when
the Guary Mir, or miracle plays, were performed. One of
them, mentioned by Doctor Borlase, “The Creation of the
World,” with Mr. Keigwyn’s Translation, the editor of this
work has given to the public, and also the Metrical History
of the Passion of our Saviour on Mount Calvary.</p>

<p>The well consecrated by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Perran is not understood to
possess any peculiar qualities, but up to the present time its
waters, accompanied by the ceremony of passing children
through the cleft of a rock on the sea shore, are believed to
cure various diseases, and particularly the rickets.</p>

<p>The encroachments of the sand have caused no less than
three churches to be built after considerable intervals of
time in this parish. The last was commenced in 1804;
and in this year (1835) a building has been discovered more
ancient than the first of the churches, and not improbably
the oratory of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Perran himself.</p>

<p>The length of this chapel within the walls is 25 feet,
<!--336.png--><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a><span class="pageno">330</span>
without 30 feet; the breadth within 12½ feet, and the
height of the walls the same.</p>

<p>At the eastern end is a neat altar of stone covered with
lime, four feet long by two and a half feet wide, and
three feet high. Eight inches above the centre of the altar
is a recess in the wall, where probably stood a crucifix;
and on the north side of the altar is a small doorway through
which the priest may have entered. Out of the whole length
the chancel extended exactly six feet. In the centre of
what may be termed the nave, in the south wall, occurs a
round-arched doorway, highly ornamented. The building
is however without any trace of window, and there is only
one small opening, apparently, for the admission of air.</p>

<p>The discovery has excited much curiosity throughout the
neighbourhood, which has unfortunately manifested itself by
the demolition of every thing curious in this little oratory,
to be borne away as relics.</p>

<p>Very little is known concerning the saint who has given
his name to the three Perrans. He is however held in
great veneration, and esteemed the patron of all Cornwall,
or at least of the mining district. By an anachronism of
fifteen hundred years or more, he was considered as the
person who first found tin; and this conviction induced
the miners to celebrate his day (the fifth of March) with so
much hilarity, that any one unable to guide himself along
the road, has received the appellation of a Perraner; and
that again, has been most unjustly reflected as a habit on
the saint.</p>

<p>It may here be worthy of remark, that, as the miners impute
the discovery of tin to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Perran, so they ascribe its
reduction from the ore, in a large way, to an imaginary
personage, Saint Chiwidden; but chi-wadden is the
white house, and must therefore mean a smelting or blowing
house, where the black ore of tin is converted into a
white metal.</p>

<p>In the Lives of the Saints, published by Doctor Butler,
where all miraculous adventures, like swimming on millstones,
<!--337.png--><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a><span class="pageno">331</span>
are carefully omitted, the following history is given
of our saint.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kiaran or Kenerin, Bishop and Confessor, called by
the Britons, Piran or Perron.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Among the Irish saints, who were somewhat older than
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick, the first and most celebrated is <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kiaran,
whom the Irish style the first-born of their saints. According
to some, he was a native of the county of Ossory,
according to others, of Cork. Usher places his birth about
the year 352. Having received some imperfect information
about the Christian faith, at thirty years of age, he
took a journey to Rome, that he might be instructed in its
heavenly doctrine, and learn faithfully to practice its precepts.
He was accompanied home by four holy clerks,
who were all afterwards bishops; their names are Lugacius,
Columban, Lugad, and Cassan.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The Irish writers suppose him to have been ordained
Bishop at Rome; but what John of Tinmouth affirms
seems far more probable, that he was one of the twelve
whom <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick consecrated Bishops in Ireland, to assist
him in planting the Gospel in that island. For his residence
he built himself a cell in a place encompassed with woods,
near the water of Fueran, which soon grew into a numerous
monastery. A town was afterwards built there, called
Saigar, now from the saint Sîer Keran. Here he converted
to the faith his family, and his whole clan, which
was that of the Osraigs, with many others. Having given
the religious veil to his mother, whose name was Lidain,
he appointed her a cell or monastery near his own, called
by the Irish Ceall Lidain. In his old age, being desirous
to  prepare himself for his passage to eternity in close
retirement, he passed into Cornwall, where he led an
eremitical life, near the Severn sea, fifteen miles from Padstow.
Certain disciples joined him, and by his words and
example, formed themselves to a true spirit of Christian
piety and humility. In this place he closed his mortal pilgrimage
by a happy death. A town upon the spot is to this
<!--338.png--><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a><span class="pageno">332</span>
day called from him <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Piran’s in the Sands; and a church
is there dedicated to God in his memory, where was formerly
a sanctuary near <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mogun’s church, upon <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Mogun’s Creek.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_11" id="fnanchor_11"></a><a href="#footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span>
 See John of Tinmouth, Usher, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> collected
by Henschenius; also Leland’s Collectanea, published
by Hearne, <abbr title="tome Three pages">tom. III. pp.</abbr> 10 and 174.”</p>

<p>It seems to be much more probable, that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Perran took
an active part with the Irish missionaries, perhaps as their
chief, since he obtained such great celebrity in this county,
than, according to Doctor Butler, that he should have
come over to Cornwall in extreme old age, and have done
his utmost to render the remaining years of his life utterly
useless to the service of his Maker or to mankind. A
white cross on a black ground was formerly the banner of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Perran, and the standard of Cornwall; probably with
some allusion to the black ore and the white metal of tin.
Capgrave says that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Perran attained an age exceeding
two hundred years.</p>

<p>In the new edition of Dugdale’s Monasticon, <abbr title="volume six page">vol. VI.
p.</abbr> 1449, an account is given of a college supposed to have
been here; but, excepting that the church was given by
King Henry the First to the Bishop and Church of Exeter,
who still enjoy the great tithes and the advowson of the
vicarage, it clearly refers to the college dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Perran in the parish of Keverne. The shrine of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Perran,
however, containing his head and other relics, was at this
place; Lysons quotes a deed in the registry of Exeter,
showing the great resort of pilgrims hither in 1485; and in
the will of Sir John Arundell 1433, occurs this bequest:
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Item lego ad usum parochie S’c’i Pyerani in Zabulo ad
claudendum capud S. Pierani honorificè et meliori modo
quo sciunt xls.</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_12" id="fnanchor_12"></a><a href="#footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span>”</p>

of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just in Penwith, son of Mr. Edward Buller of Portlooe,
and brother of the judge.</p>

<p>Chiverton, having belonged to the Arundells, was sold
in 1703 to John Rosogan, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> In 1724 it was again sold
to Mr. John Andrew of Trevellance, maternal great-grandfather
to the late John Thomas, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> an eminent attorney,
and afterwards Vice Warden of the Stannaries, where Mr.
Thomas built an excellent house with extensive gardens
and plantations; this place has descended to his only daughter,
who married William Peter, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> of Haslyn, member
for Bodmin in the Parliament of 1832. They have still
further improved the place, and made it their chief residence.</p>

This parish takes its name [from], and is dedicated to,
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paternus, who was descended from an ancient family in
Armorica, from whence he sailed into Ireland, and living
there some time incognito, went from thence into Wales; here
his piety and conduct raised him such an interest that the
princes of that country, then at variance, laid down their
arms at his application. Camden in Cardiganshire tells us,
that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patern resided there, and had a church there dedicated
to his memory, called Llan Badern Vaur, the church
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patern the Great.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patern hath likewise two churches here and in Devon
dedicated to him, this and North Pederwyn; and having
done great service to religion in Wales, he returned
into his native country of Armorica, at the instance of his
countrymen, where he was received with great respect by
Sampson the younger, Archbishop of Dole. The French
Bretons keep three holidays in honour of his memory, one
upon the day he procured peace among the Welsh princes,
the second upon his going into orders, and the third upon
the anniversary of his death, which happened about the
year 540, and is, I suppose, the day on which the church
celebrates his memory, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> <abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> the 12th.</p>

<p>In anno 1291, 20th Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> (<abbr title="Taxio Beneficiorum">Tax. Benef.</abbr>) the rectory

<p>There is but little to add respecting this parish, which is
one of the very few livings held by the University of Oxford,
only five in all, with one lectureship.</p>

It stands with a lofty tower on an elevated station; and,
being quite surrounded by trees, the whole is conspicuous
and beautiful.</p>

There are some annual fairs kept in the church town;
and the parish has three other villages, Trecroogo, Tregallen,
and Trethevy.</p>

<p>Several of the farms were in former times the property
and the residences of small gentlemen.</p>

<p>The principal places are,</p>

<p>Trebersey, where resided the family of Gedy, of whom
Richard Gedy was Sheriff of Cornwall in the year 1623,
the 21st of King James the First. His daughter and heiress
became the wife of Sir John Eliot the celebrated patriot,
and in their descendants the property remained till the
decease of Mr. John Eliot, about thirty years ago. This
gentleman, who was Sheriff in 1776, devised his property
to Mr. William Eliot, of Port Eliot, his distant relation.
Mr. Eliot took down the old house, and built a large and
handsome mansion at some little distance from the former;
but, succeeding to Port Eliot and the family property, on
the death of his elder brother, he disposed of Trebersey to
David Howell, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who has made it his residence.</p>

<p>The Editor has grounds for believing that his father,
the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Edward Giddy, was a descendant in the fourth
degree, from a nephew of Mr. Richard Gedy of Trebersey,
who settled in the West of Cornwall.</p>

<p>Tresmarrow, a seat of the Pipers, previously to their occupying
Madford, adjoining to Launceston, came with the
heiress of that family, to a younger son of Sir Richard Vyvyan
of Trelowarren; their son, Mr. Philip Vyvyan, having married
Mary, the daughter of Sheldon Walter, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> acquired Tremeal
in the same parish, where he resided. Mr. Vyvyan left
two sons and a daughter: Vvol, the eldest, succeeded to the
family property, on the decease of his father’s first cousin,
the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Sir Carew Vyvyan. The second son married,
but died without a family. The daughter, Harriot, married
Stephen Luke, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> M.D.; and on the sale and division
of Mr. Philip Vyvyan’s landed property, Dr. Luke acquired
Tresmarrow, which is now become a farm house.</p>

<p>Tremeal has been noticed above. Mr. Philip Vyvyan
<!--344.png--><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a><span class="pageno">338</span>
either rebuilt or greatly improved the house. After his
decease, it was sold to Mr. Archer, brother to Mr. Archer
of Trelaske, who resided here for some time: but, experiencing
one of the most severe afflictions to which human
nature is exposed, by losing the dearest of all friends, he
reduced the house to a fit dwelling for one who should
occupy the farm, and abandoned a place deprived of all its
attractions and of all its charms.</p>

<p>A very different picture is presented to the mind by a
monumental inscription in the churchyard, which has been
frequently copied on account of its strange absurdity.</p>

<p>The church is neat but small, and very inadequate to the
increased number of inhabitants in the parish: the tower,
like most others in this part of Cornwall, is of granite.
Phillack stands near the eastern branch of Hayle River, and
towards the sea, from whence comminuted shell sand is continually
brought inland by the wind, threatening to overwhelm
the whole village. Notice has been taken under
Lelant of this ordinary incroachment of the sand, and of
the inundations which have occurred at different periods
remote from each other. Very considerable parts of Phillack,
and of Gwithian the adjoining parish, are covered
with sand formed into hillocks of twenty or thirty feet high,
<!--346.png--><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340"></a><span class="pageno">340</span>
representing in miniature one of the most uneven districts
that can any where be found. Under these are frequently
discovered fences, inclosures, and the walls of houses; and
the high valuation of the living in Wolsey’s Survey seems
to prove that much land must have been covered with sand
since that time, and converted into what is named <span class="title">Towan</span>.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this loss, however great it may have
been, the parish has flourished in recent times, far beyond
all former example or expectation, by the extension of
trade, and by the consequent improvement of the harbour.
The progress in both has been greatly accelerated by the
successful working of various mines in the immediate neighbourhood;
but the first step was taken when a copper
smelting establishment was made there, soon after the
middle of the last century.</p>

<p>An opinion, or rather a feeling, had prevailed in Cornwall
that the copper ores should be smelted at home, and not
sent to the opposite coast of Wales. Nothing could be
more erroneous. About three times the quantity of coal
is required to smelt any given weight of the copper ore; and
the importation of coal from Swansea being very large, the
conveyance of copper ore there produced alternate cargos.
The whole scheme seems to have originated in mistaken
analogies drawn from ordinary operations.</p>

<p>A plan so injudicious and adopted without estimate or
consideration must have failed, and would have done so at
once, but for the counteracting power of individual ability,
in the person of Mr. John Edwards; a young man of Ludyan,
who had been recommended at a very early age, to
some situation requiring talent, by our celebrated historian
Doctor William Borlase. Mr. Edwards speedily acquired
the entire management and direction of the whole concern,
which soon extended itself to the importation of coal, timber,
limestone, iron, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> for the supply of the neighbourhood;
and by the unwearied exertion of his superior genius, the
business continued with success up to the period of his
decease in <abbr title="January">Jan.</abbr> 1807.</p>

<p><!--347.png--><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a><span class="pageno">341</span>
Mr. Edwards may be reckoned among the distinguished
persons whom Cornwall has produced, equal in number at
the least, as we flatter ourselves, with those of any
similar district. He acquired extensive general knowledge,
and obtained an ascendancy over most persons on all occasions.
Mr. Edwards had a numerous family, but only two
have married: his eldest daughter to Mr. John Tippett;
and their son has succeeded to the large property of Mr.
Vivian of Pencalenick, and taken the name.</p>

<p>His youngest son, Mr. Joseph Edwards, married Miss
Devonshire of Truro, where he practised the Law with
great credit and success.</p>

<p>The company directed by Mr. Edwards experienced the
rivalship in trade of a very able and enterprising individual
Mr. John Harvey, and after his decease, still more powerfully
of his son. Each party in this legitimate and beneficial
contest endeavoured to improve their respective portions
of the harbour, and by so doing acted favourably on
the whole. Mr. Edwards led the way by extending a
mound across the eastern arm, and keeping back the high
water at flood tide, which being suffered to escape through
gates some hours afterwards, swept the sand before it, and
deepened the channel. Mr. Harvey on his part constructed
quays and wharfs, and recently a sluice, so that the interior
of the harbour may be considered as improved to the
utmost extent; but works are still wanting to confine the
current of water beyond the entrance, and thus to force a
channel through the bar, produced here as in all other
debouches of rivers, by the deposit of silt, of sand, or of mud,
where the currents meet and occasion comparatively still
water.</p>

<p>A work most beneficial to the whole country was completed
at Hayle in the year 1825, under the authority of an
Act of Parliament. The passage across the main estuary
was frequently dangerous and always interrupted by the
tide; several of the branches could not be passed at high
water, and lives were not unfrequently lost. A causeway
<!--348.png--><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a><span class="pageno">342</span>
provided with arches and parapets, now affords a safe line of
communication from Penzance and the Western Peninsula,
to the eastward; and all the roads are raised above the
utmost range of the tide.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons notices two castles said to have formerly
stood in this parish, one still called Castle Cayle; but it
seems to be very doubtful whether any castellated house was
ever built there, or even a military work, as the word castle
appears to have been frequently applied in ridicule, and there
are not extant any accounts relating to this place.</p>

<p>The other, situated at the entrance of the river, a much
more probable situation, and called Riviere or Theodore’s
Castle. The walls, if any ever existed, are taken down, and
all traces of a foundation are hidden by the sand.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitaker, who captivates every reader by the brilliancy
of his style, and astonishes by the extent of his multifarious
reading, draws, however, without reserve on his
fertile imagination for whatever facts may be requisite to
construct the fabric of a theory. He has made Riviere
the palace and residence of Theodore, a sovereign Prince
of Cornwall, and conducts <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Breca, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Iva, with several
companions, not only into Hayle and to this palace, after
their voyage from Ireland, but fixes the time of their arrival
so exactly as to make it take place in the night. In recent
times the name of Riviere, which had been lost in the common
pronunciation, Rovier, has revived in a very excellent
house built by Mr. Edwards on the farm, which he completed
in 1791.</p>

<p>The place of most importance in Phillack was Trevassack,
for many years the residence of the Yorkes, a considerable
family from Somersetshire.</p>

<p>Richard Yorke, of Wellington, married a daughter of
Andrew Luttrell, of Dunster Castle; and his grandson,
Humphry Yorke, settled at Trevassack; married Barbara,
daughter of John Vyvyan, of Trelowarren; and their
granddaughter, Sarah Yorke, was the mother of Attorney-general
Noye. Some traces of its former splendour may
<!--349.png--><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a><span class="pageno">343</span>
still be discovered. Erasmus Pascoe, who served the office
of Sheriff in 1720, resided at this place; it now belongs to
the partnership carrying on copper-smelting and trade
at Hoyle.</p>

<p>In much more modern times a good house has been built
on Bodrigy, which belonged to a branch of the Pendarveses,
then to Williams, and was sold by three sisters, coheiresses
of that family, to Mr. John Curnow, who acquired
a large fortune by carrying on the trade of Hoyle for more
than half a century, before modern energies altered and
extended the scale of every mercantile transaction.</p>

<p>Mr. Curnow also purchased Penpoll, and resided there.
His property became ultimately divided between three
daughters, one of whom married Mr. Robert Oke Millett,
who succeeded Mr. Curnow at Penpoll, and has made it a
handsome place. It now belongs to his son, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John
Curnow Millett. Another daughter married the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William
Hocken, the late Rector of the parish: and the third
married Mr. Parmenter from Ilfracombe. Mr. Curnow
was of the family mentioned under Lugvan.</p>

<p>Treglisson is a large farm, having on it a good house
inhabited for many years by the family of Nichols, proprietors
of the freehold.</p>

<p>Phillack, in addition to the copper works at Hoyle, possesses
also a tin smelting house at a village called indifferently
Angarrack or Vellarvrane. It is said to be the first
smelting house established by Becher and the other Germans
for smelting tin ores in reverberatory furnaces by
means of coal. During the life of Mr. William Tremaine
the late managing partner, this place was decorated with the
finest garden in the West of Cornwall.</p>

<p>The advowson of this Rectory was in the Arundell
family, but held for a considerable time on a lease for lives,
by the Collinses of Treworgan in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Erme: but on the
death of Mr. Edward Collins in <abbr title="January">Jan.</abbr> 1734, the lease having
expired, and the presentation having reverted to Lord Arundell,
a Catholic, the exercise of the right for that turn lapsed
<!--350.png--><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a><span class="pageno">344</span>
to the University of Oxford; and the living was given by
convocation to the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William Glover from Worcestershire,
originally a member of Balliol College, and afterwards
one of the Chaplains of All Souls. He married a daughter
of the preceding Rector, and resided at Phillack all the
remainder of his life.</p>

<p>To guard against a similar lapse, a new lease for lives
was granted by Lord Arundell to Mr. Hockin of Gwithian,
whose son succeeded to Mr. Glover; and on the general
sale of the Arundell property, this gentleman had the
opportunity of purchasing the freehold, and his son the
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William Hockin is now the Patron and Rector of
Phillack.</p>

<p>The parish feast is kept on the nearest Sunday to the

Pope and Martyr.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DOCTOR BOASE.</p>

<p>The rocks of this parish, like those of Gwinear adjoining,
belong to the prophyritic series; the northern part is
covered with hillocks of sand, a considerable portion of
which, as on some part of Gwithian, has been drifted from
place to place by the action of the wind; this to a certain
extent is now prevented by a covering of arenaceous plants,
the extensive fibrous roots of which form a loose spongy
net work, which serves to retain the sand in its place. This
sand was originally of marine origin, being at low levels
entirely composed of fragments of marine shells; but inland,
on more elevated places, a considerable portion of terrestrial
<!--351.png--><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a><span class="pageno">345</span>
shell enters into its composition: these have been
derived from the myriads of the snail tribe, which browse
on the scanty herbage of these dreary <em>Towans</em>. The inland
drifts, after a strong wind, will be found to consist almost
entirely of the fragments of those land shells. On the coast
this testaceous sand is in several places consolidated into
calcareous sandstone; but this has taken place on a more
extended scale in the parish of Crantock.</p>

being one of the manors which William the Conqueror
gave to Robert Earl of Morton, when he made him Earl of
Cornwall.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons gives a short history of the principal or only
manors in this parish. The manors of Pillaton and Hardenfast
were at an early period in a family bearing the
singular name of Inkpen; then they belonged to Dorothy
Dillington, heiress of John Charles, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> who sold them
to Thomas Moone. From this gentleman, Mr. Lysons
says the manors passed to the family of Coryton, although
he does not state in what way. They were ultimately
devised by Sir John Coryton, who died in 1739, to his
widow, and by her to the family of Helyar.</p>

<p>Pentillie Castle is in this parish, one of the most splendid
seats in the whole county, as well in regard to the magnificence
of the castellated house constructed by the present
proprietor, John Tillie Coryton, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> on the site of a
former house called Pentillie Castle, as to the beauty and
grandeur of the scenery, and to the romantic hill and dale
of the grounds.</p>

<p>This place was the seat of Sir James Tillie, who left the
property to his sister’s son, Mr. James Woolley, who took
the name of Tillie, and his granddaughter brought the
estate to the late John Coryton, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> Sheriff of Cornwall in
1782, as his son has been in 1808.</p>

<p>The church and tower are not distinguished from others
in the neighbourhood, except by a south transverse aisle
belonging to Pentillie, and containing monuments to different
members of the family. In the body of the church is
an inscription commemorating the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Ralph Eliot, who
died in 1625, having been Rector of the parish during
fifty years.</p>

<p>The church town is small, and there is but one other
village, called Penters Cross.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Weston Helyar was patron of the rectory.</p>

<p>This parish, although it is small and situated in a remote

and a well-built church, with various monuments, placed

<p>The manor, including the whole parish, originally without
doubt in possession of the lands, although it is now
become, like innumerable other manors, a mere royalty,
was given by Hubert de Burgh, Earl of Kent, to the Abbey
<!--356.png--><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350"></a><span class="pageno">350</span>
of Clyve in Somersetshire. It is an instance, however, of
the small reliance that can be placed on the orthography
of ancient names, since the charter of Hubert de Burgo is
in these words:</p>

<p><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Sciant præsentes et futuri, quod ego Hubertus de
Burgo Domini Regis Camerarius, dedi, concessi, et hac

antecessorum et parentum et herædum meorum, in perpetuam
elemosinam, totum dominicum quod habui in
Rugeham,”</span> which must be Poughill.</p>

<p>And in a charter of confirmation by Richard Earl of
Cornwall it is thus mentioned:</p>

<p lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Richardus comes Pictaviæ et Cornubiæ, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> noverit

<p>Mr. Lysons, who, from his situation in the Tower, possessed
the most ample means of ascertaining all transactions
with the Crown, states that King James the First sold this
manor to two gentlemen, Mr. George Salter and Mr.
John Williams; in more recent times it belonged to the
family of Stanbury, and is now the property of Thomas
<a name="err_13" id="err_13"></a>Troad, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr></p>

<p>Mr. Lysons relates, on the authority of William of Worcester,
that Nicholas Radford, counsel for Lord Bonville,
against Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon, was slain in his
own house in the year 1437, by Thomas Courtenay, eldest
son, and afterwards successor to his father. There is, however,
an anachronism as to William Bonville, who was first
summoned to Parliament twelve years afterwards, as Baron
Bonville, and died in 1480, leaving the barony in fee to
his great-granddaughter, married to Thomas Grey, Marquis
of Dorset.</p>

Stamford, commanding the parliamentary army in 1643;
and where Sir Beville Granville, commanding the Cornish
army, obtained one of the most splendid victories achieved
during the whole course of the civil war. It is unnecessary
to repeat the details of this battle, which are given by Hyde

decided the struggle in favour of the party supporting the
system of hereditary power in a single hand.</p>

<p>Penfoune was likewise the seat of a very ancient family,

<p>But this family, by Mr. Hals’s mistake, being already
treated of in Jacobstowe, I shall only add here, that in
Domesday Book is a manor called Penfon, by which probably
this place is meant; and if so, it was one of those
given by William the Conqueror to Robert Earl of Morton,
when he made him Earl of Cornwall.</p>

<p>The church of this parish is situated in a pleasant valley,
but without any thing peculiar by which it may be distinguished
from others.</p>

<p>The principal village in the parish is called Tregoll.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons says that Poundstock was held under the
manor of Launcels, citing the Exeter Domesday; and that
the manor of West Widemouth was granted by Reginald
Earl of Cornwall, to William Botreaux, from whom it
passed by female heirs to the families of Hungerford and
Hastings; from the last it was purchased by the Granvilles,
and now belongs to Lord Carteret.</p>

<p>The manor of Woolston was purchased by the late Lord
Dunstanville.</p>

<p>The great tithes of this parish were purchased by Mr.
George Browne of Bodmin, when the whole Arundell property
in Cornwall was sold, about fifty years ago; and now
belong to his grandson.</p>

<p>The advowson of the vicarage is in John Dayman, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>
and the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Charles Dayman, was instituted as Vicar in
1809.</p>

<p>That part of the parish which joins with <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clement’s

<p>The barton of Trehane, which signifies the Old
Town, gave name to an ancient family who flourished a
long time in this place, and gave for their arms, Argent,
<!--361.png--><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a><span class="pageno">355</span>
three bars Sable, charged with nine martlets of the
First.</p>

<p>―― Scawen, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> sold this barton in the early part
of the 17th century, to John Williams of Carvean, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>
only brother to William Williams of Trewithgy, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>
Mr. Williams built a large brick house here, but died very
soon after that he got into it, leaving three daughters by
his wife, the only daughter and heir of John Courtenay of
Tregelles, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> who died a few days before him in childbed;
for grief of which, it is said, he broke his heart: he
left three daughters, Mary, Ann, and Catherine, all very
young, and up to this time all unmarried (about 1730).
But that his estate might not be divided, he gave it solely
to his eldest daughter Mary, who now possesses it, with a
considerable estate of the duchy adjoining. The arms are
the same with Williams of Trevorva.</p>

<p>Not far from Trehane is Carvean, or the Little Town,
which was the seat in lease (it belonging to the manor of
Gowlden) to the above mentioned John Williams, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> on
whose death it fell into the lord’s hand, who granted a new
lease of it to William Hobbs, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr></p>

<p>Joining with Carvean, there being nothing between them
but a road, is Trewother, which was for several generations
the seat in lease of the family of Huddy, the freehold being
in the Trevanions of Carhays.</p>

<p>I next come to the manor of Trelowthes, which I take
to be the same which is called by Mr. Carew Trelowith,
which means the town place of trees.</p>

<p>Next is the manor of Trewithgy, alias Trenowith, alias
Treworgy; but as I take the first to be the right name, I
give its interpretation, which doth signify a town of trees
by the river.</p>

<p>Francis Tregian, pronounced Trudgean, forfeited this
with his other estates.</p>

<p>Trevorva, which may mean Trevor and va, for da, the
dwelling on the good road, but called so, I suppose, by the
rule of contraries, the road being one of the deepest and
<!--362.png--><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a><span class="pageno">356</span>
worst in the whole country; but which according to the
old proverb is</p>

<p class="center">Bad for the rider, but good for the bider<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="unindent">making amends by the richness of its soil.</p>

<p>This barton, which is of a very good yearly value, was
once the dwelling of a family bearing the same name; the
last of which family had an only daughter and heir, who
married &mdash;&mdash; Williams of Herringstone in the county of
Dorset, which match was the first settling of that family in
Cornwall.</p>

<p>The arms of Williams are, Argent, a greyhound current
between three Cornish choughs Proper, within a plain border
Gules, charged with six crosses formee Or and as many
Bezants.</p>

<p>The present Mr. Williams, owner of this barton, lives at
a place adjoining called Trewithan, where the family
removed, probably disliking the dirty situation of Trevorva.</p>

<p class="p2 center smaller">TREWITHAN, THE TOWN OR DWELLING OF TREES.</p>

<p>This place lies high and very pleasantly.</p>

<p>After the Williams’s had flourished for some time at
Trewithan, Courtenay Williams, when he had foolishly
squandered away a pretty estate, and a good fortune too,
which he had with his wife Elizabeth, the eldest daughter
and coheir of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> &mdash;&mdash; May, also M.D. sold this
barton for £2700 to Philip Hawkins, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> brother to the
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Hawkins of Pennance, and a member in this present
Parliament (1730) for Granpont. He now resides
here, has very much improved this seat, new built a great
part of the house, made good gardens, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p class="p2 center smaller">THE MANOR OF WALVEDEN, GULDEN, OR GOLDEN.</p>

<p>There flourished for a long series of years a family of the
<!--363.png--><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a><span class="pageno">357</span>
same name, the last of which, John Walveden, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> had
only two daughters and coheirs, of whom the eldest having
married &mdash;&mdash; Tregion, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> brought to her husband this
and several other fair estates. The other sister, Catherine,
married Nicholas Carminow, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> of Trenouth in this parish.
On the decease of his father-in-law, which happened
in the year 1514, Mr. Tregian settled himself here, and
lived in great splendour. Leland mentions the house as
building, and Carew says, Walvedon, alias Golden, fell
into Tregion, by match with the inheritrix thereof.</p>

<p>Their son married an Arundell of Lanherne. Their
grandson with the Lord Stourton’s daughter.</p>

<p>The arms of Tregion are Ermine, on a chief Sable, three
birds Or, beaked and legged Argent.</p>

<p>But Mr. Carew, though it happened in his time, does
not mention the great misfortune which befel their grandchild,
Francis Tregian, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> though it was not long before
(twenty-five years) and ended in the total ruin of this
wealthy and flourishing family; in giving an account of
which I will be as brief as the thing will bear. Mr. Camden
has touched on it in his Annals of Queen Elizabeth,
(<abbr title="Anno Domini">A. D.</abbr> 1577, Reg. 19): <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Hactenus serena tranquillitas
Pontificiis in Angliâ affulsit, qui quâdam misericordi conniventiâ
sua sacra inter privatos parietes, licet illa legibus
interdicta, pecuniariâ mulctâ inflictâ, quodam modo impune
celebrarant, nec Regina vim conscientiæ afferendam censuit.
Verùm postquam illud fulmen excommunicationis
Romæ in Reginam fuisset ejaculatum, in nubes et tempestates
serenitas illa paulatim abiit, legemque elicuit anno
1571, contra eos, qui ejusmodi Bullas, Agnos Dei, et grana
benedicta, papalis obsequii tesseras, in regnum intulerint,
aut aliquum Romanæ ecclesiæ reconciliarint, ut diximus.
Primus hâc lege tenebatur Cuthbertus Mainus sacerdos,
qui Pontificiæ contra Principem potentiæ assertor pervicax,”</span>
without any overt act, as far as appears here, against the new
law, by bringing in any bulls, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> or by reconciling any to
<!--364.png--><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a><span class="pageno">358</span>
the Church of Rome, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ad fanum Stephani (Launston
vulgo vocant) in Cornwalliâ supplicio affectus, et Trugionis
nobilis qui eum hospitio acceperat”</span> [only had entertained
him in his house], <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“fortunas eversus perpetuoque carceri
adjudicatus.”</span> And that you may see what a noble fortune
he lost, it being his hard hap to be the first, as Cuthbert
Maine to suffer death, so he to lose his estate and liberty
by this severe law; and being besides myself descended
from this gentleman’s sister, Jane Tregian, married to
Thomas Tonkin of Trevaunance, I shall here set down
an abstract of an exemplification of the inquisition taken at
Lanceston, 5 <abbr title="Charles One">Car. I.</abbr> in the lands, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> of the said Mr.
Tregian, of which I shall give only the substance.

<p>But note here that you are not to judge of the real value
of Mr. Tregian’s estate by this return, except it be in the
manor of Gowlden, where the demesne is valued as well as
the rents. I have heard several intelligent people say, that
the estate of this family in this county alone, was worth at
the least £3000 per annum, besides a large sum they were
possessed of in ready money, which enabled them to build
such a noble house here, of which the remains are still
magnificent; and among these, under an old tower, they
still show the place where Cuthbert Mayne the priest was
found concealed.</p>

<p>Norden says, that Mr. Tregion remained in prison full
twenty years, but that he was released by an order of
Queen Elizabeth herself about 1597, and that he afterwards
lived near London, supported, as was believed, by
the bounty of his friends. Francis Tregion the son, having
repossessed himself by purchase and by favour of some
part of the property taken from his father, found that he
could not stem the tide raised against him by persons
envious of his returning prosperity, or eager to obtain the
plunder of his possessions, as had been done by his father;
for in January 1608, this persecuted family suffered in his
person a further and second loss of their estates, in some
degree owing perhaps to the strong feelings of apprehension
<!--367.png--><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"></a><span class="pageno">361</span>
and of resentment occasioned by the Gunpowder Plot of
November the 5th, three years before.</p>

<p>Mr. Tregion, resolving to do the best that he could,
received some money by compounding with various parties
to confirm their titles, and thus embarked for Spain, where,
as it is said, he was very well received on account of his
own and his father’s sufferings for religion, and that he
was made a grandee of that Kingdom; and that his posterity
still flourish there with the title of Marquis of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Angelo. Whether this be true or not I cannot affirm,
having it only by tradition; however, we hear no more of
him in this country.</p>

<p>The next that we find in possession of this barton, and
living there, was Ezekiel Grose: he died here, and left it to
his only daughter and heir, married to &mdash;&mdash; Buller, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> of
Shillingham, with a great estate in other parishes, in whose
posterity it continued till the year 1710, when James Buller,
<abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> the last of that branch, dying without issue, gave the
whole by will to his great-uncle, who had acquired Morval
through a marriage with the heiress of Coode.</p>

<p>Talbot, which is an abbreviation of Haleboat, says Norden,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 61, is a rock called Ha-le-boate rock, wherein to
this day are seen many great iron rings, whereunto boats
have been tied, although there is now no show of an haven,
but only a little brook running through the valley into a
branch of the River Fall.</p>

<p>To the north-east of Gowlden lies Tredenham, a small
manor which the late Sir Joseph Tredenham believed to
be Denhamstown, and derived himself from a younger
branch of the family which formerly resided there, which
he also testified by his arms, Argent, a bend lozengy Gules,
by way of distinction, as was usual in former times, from
the parent stock, which gave Gules, three lozenges in fess
Ermine. But however that may be, this was the seat of
the Tredenhams for many generations, till they removed,
first to Kellion in Cornelly, and then to Tregonnan in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Ewe.</p>

<p><!--368.png--><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a><span class="pageno">362</span>
This small manor, from which some estates are held, particularly
Corvith in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cuby, was sold with the greater
part of the Tredenham property in 1727, to Doctor John
Hawkins of Pennance, who is the present lord of it.</p>

<p class="p2 center smaller">CURVOZA.</p>

<p>That is the walled or fortified town, so called from an
intrenchment, for voza properly signifies a trench or place
cast up. This trench was measured for me by Mr. Joseph
Webber, steward to Miss Mary Williams of Trehane, the
proprietor; and it proved to be two hundred and ten paces
in circumference.</p>

<p>[Car or Cair is a fort, and voza and voran are the plural
of voz or vore, a ditch (see Pryce’s Vocabulary). Corvoza
would therefore be the entrenched fort. <span class="sc"><abbr title="Editor">Ed.</abbr></span>]</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The church at Probus is large, but not remarkable for
any thing beyond other churches in the neighbourhood.
In it are some monuments, and especially one to Mr. Thomas
Hawkins of Trewithon, sometime member for Grampound,
who died in 1766. This gentleman not having
passed the small-pox, and resolving on being inoculated,
thought it was his duty to extend the same benefit to all his
neighbours in the parish. Several scores had in consequence
this dreadful disease communicated to them in its mitigated
form, and all recovered except the benevolent individual
himself, who thus extensively introduced inoculation, at
that time a novelty in Cornwall among the great mass of
the people. He is supposed to have carried too far the
asthenic system for counteracting fever, and perhaps to
have taken the contagion, in what is termed the natural
way, previously to the artificial communication.</p>

<p>Although the church is not superior to others around it,
the tower is on the whole more magnificent than any other
<!--369.png--><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a><span class="pageno">363</span>
in the county. The tower at Weck <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary, near Stratton,
is said to be somewhat more lofty; and several exceed
that at Probus in elegance and lightness of proportions,
but this combines massiveness, altitude, and elaborate decoration;
moreover, it has been built since the Reformation,
and according to tradition, by the voluntary contributions
of the unmarried inhabitants of the parish; but the same is
said of a lofty tower at Derby; and of the windows of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Neot’s Church, one is given by the unmarried men, and
another by the single women of that parish.</p>

<p>It is quite clear that this church was collegiate, having a
dean and a certain number of prebendaries, founded in
very early times before the Norman Conquest, and probably
by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Edward. The Deanery became attached with its
share of the endowments to the Church of Exeter, but in
a way which Mr. Whitaker himself has not succeeded in
clearly making out. The prebendaries or some of them
remained till the general dissolution, when the prebends
were given or sold, and have passed through the Williams’s,
by purchase to the Hawkins family, with some fairs. One
fair, however, is the grant of King Charles the Second.
Few gentlemen’s houses in the west of Cornwall were
without the honour of receiving Prince Charles during his
residence in Cornwall, about the middle part of the civil
wars; and he is said to have remained for a time longer
than usual with Mr. Williams, who, after the Restoration,
waited on the King with congratulations from the parish;
and on being complimented by him with the question
whether he could do any thing for his friends, answered
that the parish would esteem themselves highly honoured
and distinguished by the grant of a fair, which was accordingly
done for the 17th of September; this fair coming the
last in succession after three others, has acquired for itself
a curious appellation derived from the two patron saints,
and from the peculiar pronunciation in that neighbourhood
of the word last, somewhat like <em>laest</em>:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<!--370.png--><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364"></a><span class="pageno">364</span>
  <div class="i0">Saint Probus and Grace,</div>
  <div class="i0">Not the first but the last,</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">&mdash;and from this distinction it is usually called Probus and
Grace fair.</p>

<p>It is utterly impossible now to give any account of these
two personages, except that they were in all probability
missionaries from Ireland. Nor is the Roman name of Probus
any objection against this supposition, since such names
were frequently assumed. The apostle of Ireland has a
Roman name, and many of the religious must have been
foreigners.</p>

<p>On repairing the east wall of the chancel some few years
since, two skeletons were found in different niches, and
one of these was declared by anatomists to have been a
female. These were supposed to be the relics of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Probus
and of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Grace, which may have been true, although
the present church cannot be less than eight hundred or a
thousand years later than their time.</p>

<p>No obvious indication can be discovered of the ancient
college; perhaps the prebendaries ceased to reside after the
deanery became absorbed at Exeter.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitaker has left several pages of memoranda on
this parish, evidently notes made at the time of his visit
there, and not arranged in any order. The Editor thinks
it therefore most expedient to adopt such parts only as
seem to explain the etymologies, or to give information
respecting facts.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitaker observes, that, although the dedication of
this parish is to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Probus alone, yet assuredly <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Grace
should be adopted also as a patron saint. The parish feast
kept in the early part of July, is always designated by their
joint names. No notice is taken of either in Bede.</p>

<p>On Carvean, Mr. Whitaker says, that it means the
Little Marsh, as cars is a bay, a marsh, or a moor, corsen
a reed, cors-hwyad in Welsh, is a fen-duck, a moorhen.</p>

<p><!--371.png--><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a><span class="pageno">365</span>
On Trewithgy.&mdash;In English a house surrounded by
trees, and lying in the water. Trewithgy, Trenowith, and
Treworgy, are different parts of the same manor. Trenowith
signifies the New Town, and Treworgy a local name,
remarkably common, as it is sure to be from its signification,
being the town upon the water, or rather perhaps, upon
the running stream.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitaker says, the manor of Probus appears from
Domesday Book to have been possessed by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Edward the
Confessor; it was therefore one of the demesnes of the
Crown at that time, and probably one of those belonging
to the sovereigns of Cornwall previously to the conquest by
the Saxons. Then I presume that an English family settled
on those lands, and held them of the Crown; probably
the Walvedons, who held them with Gowlden.</p>

<p>On this barton is an angular fort, says Borlase, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 313
of his Antiquities, second edition, “on the barton of
Wolvedon, alias Golden, in the parish of Probus, which
has a wide deep ditch, the entire edge or counterscarp of
which was faced upwards with masonry of thin stones in
cement, which had round turrets or buttresses (such as
neither Saxons, Danes, nor Britons had, as far as ever I
can find) of the same masonry, interspersed with the straight
lines of the ditch. This is very singular in our county,
where most of our ancient fortifications are of a circular
plan, without any projections (angular or circular) from the
master line. I can judge this, therefore, neither to be
British, Saxon, nor Danish, as being like no other work of
these people, and from the artful fence of this ditch, as
well as from the polygon which the whole forms, I guess it
to be a Roman work. There is a large avenue or way from
the north, rising from an adjoining valley.</p>

<p>This fortified ground I examined in August 1792. It is
an earthwork denominated Warren, containing six Cornish
acres, as the farmer told me, or about seven statute acres.
It has a high and broad rampart twelve or fourteen feet
high, and a deep ditch fourteen or sixteen feet wide. The
<!--372.png--><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366"></a><span class="pageno">366</span>
whole forms a long square, the greatest length from east to
west. It has two gateways on the north, and two on the
south, one on the east, and one on the west, each answering
to the other, and having a raised avenue across the ditch.
I therefore conclude it to be a Roman camp, made at the
period when that people subdued Cornwall, and calculated
for the reception of a large detachment. The revetments
mentioned by Dr. Borlase do not appear, nor the projecting
turrets. About a mile to the north of this, beyond a deep
gully, may be found what is noticed by Mr. Tonkin as
Caer Voza, and noticed by Doctor Borlase in his Natural
History, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 324, as Caerfos or Caerfosou. This is an estate,
called so from a field close to the house, which has a
strong and lofty rampart upon the north side, and a large
deep ditch upon the north of that. These continue all
along the northern side of the field, and have a slight
return on the east and west towards the south; but then
they cease, nor can any traces be found of them afterwards.
Perhaps this imperfect work may have been a camp of the
Britons opposed to that of the Romans, or one commenced
at least for that purpose.</p>

<p>Thus far Mr. Whitaker.</p>

<p class="p2">Trehane, with a considerable property around it, were
given, as Mr. Tonkin has stated, by the last Mr. Williams
of that place, to his eldest daughter Mary, who married the
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William Stackhouse, <abbr title="Doctor of Divinity">D.D.</abbr> Rector of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Erme, the
adjoining parish. Doctor Stackhouse was from the county
of Durham, a brother of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Thomas Stackhouse,
Vicar of Beenham, Berks, well known by his learned works.</p>

<p>A complete body of Divinity&mdash;A fair statement of the
controversy between Mr. Woolston and his adversaries,&mdash;and
various others; but above all by an History of the Bible
from the beginning of the World to the establishment
of Christianity, in two volumes folio, first printed in 1732,
a work that has gone through various editions, and may be
found in every good library.</p>

<p><!--373.png--><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367"></a><span class="pageno">367</span>
Doctor Stackhouse left two sons, William and John.
His eldest son William, married one of the Miss Rashleighs
of Menabilly, and settled at Trehane, where he lived
universally esteemed and respected till June 1830, when he
departed this life in his 90th year, leaving Trehane to
his eldest son, who resides there at present. Mr. John
Stackhouse, whose son Edward William Wynne Pendarves
represents the county in Parliament, is noticed under
Cambourne.</p>

<p class="p2 center smaller">TREWITHAN.</p>

<p>This place ranks among the principal seats in Cornwall.
It stands on a commanding situation, possesses extensive
plantations, and looks over those to the south and east into
vallies highly cultivated and rendered beautiful by wood
and water, the two most pleasing ingredients in rural landscapes.
The house was in part built by Mr. Courtenay
Williams, who is said to have dissipated a handsome fortune
by indulging himself in low pursuits and in low company,
and especially by maintaining a set of people to accompany
him from parish to parish, for (what seems quite ludicrous
in present times) the purpose of ringing the bells; yet
about the middle of the last century a new peal of bells was
procured for Kenwyn Church, to accommodate the principal
inhabitants of Truro with that exercise and amusement.</p>

<p>After the purchase of this place, together with the manor
of Probus, the appropriated share of the great tithes, the
lease under the Church of Exeter conveying the remainder
part for lives, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Mr. Philip Hawkins made Trewithan his
residence, and represented Grampound in three or four Parliaments
in the Reign of George the Second; but not having
any family himself, nor his brothers, almost the whole of their
landed properties were devised to their eldest sister Mary,
who had married her distant relation, Mr. Christopher
Hawkins of Helston, and of Trewinnard in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Erth.
<!--374.png--><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a><span class="pageno">368</span>
Their only son Mr. Thomas Hawkins, succeeded his uncle
at Trewithan, and also represented Grampound: he married
Ann, daughter of James Heywood, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> of London;
but being unfortunately taken out of this life while he
endeavoured to introduce the most important discovery
ever made in medicine, for the benefit of others as well as
of himself, he left five children minors, Philip, Christopher,
Thomas, John, and a daughter. Philip and Thomas
died in early life; the estate, therefore, devolved on Christopher,
who having never married, died in May 1829, and
in consideration probably of the large fortune possessed by
his brother, devised the whole of his real property to
Henry Hawkins, his brother’s younger son, then about
eight years old, to whom it now belongs.</p>

<p>But the affair which most peculiarly distinguishes this
parish is the persecution of Mr. Tregion.</p>

<p>It appears from Camden’s Annales of Queen Elizabeth,
inserted above, and from contemporary historians, that,
although enactments were made (they must not be honoured
with the name of laws) against Catholics, imposing penalties
and disabilities, and prohibiting altogether the celebration
of their peculiar rites supposed to conciliate the Divine
favour&mdash;yet if masses were performed without ostentation,
and under a decent veil of secrecy, or if auricular confessions
were made and absolutions received in private, little notice
was taken of them, nor were priests eagerly sought after,
who divested themselves in public of all peculiar and
discriminating habits, and abstained from attempting
proselytism. But when the Church of Rome thundered
its excommunications against the Queen, when plots became
more manifest at home, connected also with the individual
nearest to the Crown, if the custom of hereditary succession
were preserved; measures of great severity were
adopted, on the ever doubtful plea of state necessity: so
that more victims to religious opinions are said to have
suffered death, banishment, or the loss of liberty, under
<!--375.png--><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"></a><span class="pageno">369</span>
this reign, than under that of Mary Tudor, whose very
name we have all been taught to associate with an epithet
denoting the utmost horror: but her persecutions were
conducted without disguise, in the name of religion, and to
make forced converts, while Elizabeth professed to act
from motives of temporal policy; moreover, the religion of
one has been deprived of all its endowments, and been proscribed
for two centuries; that of the other, most happily for
ourselves, has flourished through the whole period.</p>

<p>It seems this Mr. Tregion and his connections were
among the first sufferers under this cruel policy. His
father married an Arundell, and himself a daughter of Lord
Stourton, both families that have continued up to the present
times in the profession of the ancient faith. Mr.
Tregion had moreover a very large estate, calculated
to excite the zeal of a well-known and detested class of
men, who from the time of the Cæsars, and doubtlessly
from a period long before, have used all means and all
pretences, sacred or profane, to advance their own fortunes
by the ruin of others.</p>

<p>Mr. Tregion, it appears, was the first or among the first
accused under the inflamed passions and the persecuting
spirit of those times, and the sheriff came in person to search
his house; but the sheriff is stated to have been a personal
friend, or at all events as a countryman and a neighbour, to
have made a slight examination, and then to have dined, and
unfortunately to have drank with the individual accused:
when</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
  <div class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;Subita incantum Dementia cepit,</div>
  <div class="i0">Ignoscenda quidem, scirent si ignoscere Manes,</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">which induced him, in the pride and confidence inspired by
wine, to reproach his guest with the insufficiency of his
search, and to conduct him to a part of the house or premises
clearly indicative of his temporary imprudence and
contempt. The sheriff, probably heated also by wine, immediately
renewed his examination, and finally discovered in
a secret hole under a turret, a Catholic clergyman, called
Cuthbert Mayne.</p>

<p><!--376.png--><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a><span class="pageno">370</span>
On this they were both arrested, and subsequently
arraigned at the Assizes, and both convicted of those
atrocious crimes: Mr. Mayne of being a Catholic Priest,
and found in England; and Mr. Tregion of having received
into his house a minister of that religion in which he had
been bred, of the religion of his forefathers, of the religion
of the father and forefathers of the highly talented Female
who then mainly directed the affairs of the state, and of the
undisputed and sole religion of the whole country about
half a century before. And for these ideal offences, (one
scruples to stain the paper with so foul a record!) was Mr.
Mayne actually hanged, and Mr. Tregion, under the sentence
of a premunire, was deprived of his whole property,
and suffered an imprisonment of twenty years.</p>

<p>Whether we contemplate the cold-hearted tyranny of
Henry the Seventh, the wild despotic sway of Henry the
Eighth, the civil dissensions in the nominal reign of his son,
the bigotry and unrelenting persecutions of Mary, or the
cruelties, however necessary, exercised by Elizabeth, we
may indeed rejoice that the great work of the Reformation
has been achieved, at any price, by the House of Tudor;
but we must join in the exclamation,</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>The northern part of this parish rests on the porphyritic
series, but no where reaches the granite hills: its rocks are
very felspathic and metalliferous. The southern part comes
<!--377.png--><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371"></a><span class="pageno">371</span>
into the calcareous series, and its rocks are like those of
Creed, Cuby, and Cornelly; the most interesting of these
rocks may be seen on the hill to the westward of Grampound.
They appear to afford a most decided example of
greywacke, exhibiting large grains, and even nodules of
quartz on their fractured surfaces; this however can only
be seen on surfaces that have been for some time exposed to
the weather; for no such appearance can be observed when
the fractures are recent and perfect. These rocks are probably
masses of compact felspar, in the bases of which
silica so predominated at the time of their formation, as
to have given rise to large concretions of quartz.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Since Doctor Boase made the geological examination of
Cornwall, an abridgment of which he has had the kindness
and the liberality to communicate for this work, the road
leading westward from Grampound, has been turned to the
north, and thus obviated a steep and even dangerous hill,
and in consequence the sections referred to can no longer
be seen on the highway.</p>

<p>The greater part of this parish belongs to Mr. Coryton
of Pentillie. Mr. Lysons gives a detail of the manors, but it

<p>Mr. Oliver, in his Historic Collections, has printed the
foundation deed of this college, premising that the public
notary has omitted to affix the date to it in Bishop Grandison’s
Register: but that by comparing it with the institution
of the first archpriest, Andrew de Tregors, in <abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 46 of
the <abbr title="third volume">3d vol.</abbr> of the same register, he was of opinion that it
must have been drawn up, either late in the year 1341, or
in the early part of 1342.</p>

<p>This foundation deed states that Sir Stephen de Haccombe
had formerly applied to Bishop Grandison to erect
the parish church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Blase at Haccombe, the burial
<!--379.png--><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373"></a><span class="pageno">373</span>
place of his ancestors, into an archpresbytery; that before
the prelate could comply with his wishes, the knight died,
but that his heir Sir John L’Ercedekne had entered into
his views, and renewed the application to the Bishop, who
had acceded to the request, and consented to the appropriation
of the parish church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hugh de Quedyock in
Cornwall, for the better support of the archpriest and his
community. The community, besides the archpriest, consisted
of five clergymen, who were called Socii, who were
bound to sing the canonical office, and to celebrate obits;
they dwelt under the same roof with the archpriest, and
lived in common. The archpriest was obliged to pay six
marks per annum to the Treasury of the Cathedral of
Exeter.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons says, in his Devonshire, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 250, that the archpriest
or rector, as he is now called, continues to exist as
the sole representative of this college, enjoying its revenues:
but certainly not the great tithes of Quethiock, since they
belong to Sir Henry Carew of Haccomb, derived through
the Courtenays. The vicarage is in the gift of the Bishop.</p>

<p>It is stated in Dr. Borlase’s Collections, that there was
formerly a chapel in this parish, or tower, dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Mary.</p>

<p>Quithiock measures 3774 statute acres.</p>

<p>In the extent of Cornish acres, 12 Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> this is
valued in twenty (Carew, <abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 48 b.) In 3 <abbr title="Henry Four">Hen. IV.</abbr> Johanna
de Rame held one great fee of Seviock, meaning (I suppose)
that she held this place as a great knight’s fee of the
said manor.</p>

<p>I take this Johanna de Rame to be the person that was
married to Stephen Durnford, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> who was Sheriff of
Cornwall, 7 Henry <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> whose only daughter and heir Jane
brought this lordship, with a large inheritance, to her husband
Sir Pierce Edgcombe of Cuttvyle, and in their posterity
it still remaineth, the honorable Richard Edgcombe,
<abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> being the present lord of this manor, and in right
thereof, patron of this parish, as was said before.</p>

<p>The arms of Rame were, in allusion to the name, Azure,
a scalp of a ram’s head Argent, armed; and Durnford’s
Azure, an eagle displayed Or.</p>

<p>But the barton of Rame hath since often changed its
owners.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.
<!--381.png--><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375"></a><span class="pageno">375</span></p>

<p>Rame church is situated in a very peculiar manner, far
out on the point of land, and immediately near a rocky
cliff. It has several monuments to former rectors and others,
but none of general interest.</p>

<p>The manor of Rame, and the advowson of the living,
continue in the Edgcumbe family; but the barton has for
some generations belonged to the Edwardses, and, under
the name of Rame Place, is still their residence.</p>

<p>The remarkable feature of this parish is Rame Head, or
as it is usually called, the Ram; and it is a general belief
that the name is really taken from the resemblance of the
point to the Roman battering ram; as the Lizard is supposed
to be so called, from the long flat serpentine formation
resembling the body of a saurian animal: but it seems to
be much more probable that these observed resemblances
should have corrupted some former names accidentally
agreeing with them in sound, than that the promontories
should be really distinguished by appellations so very modern.</p>

<p>Near the extremity of the point are the ruins of a chapel
still very visible, dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael, as all chapels
similarly situated were dedicated by our ancestors, from the
habits of a winged angel being assimilated to those of birds.</p>

<p>The Ram Head itself exhibits the appearance of a grand
mass of rocks gradually tapering into the sea, much resembling
Cudden Point in the Mount’s Bay. It forms the
exterior boundary of Plymouth Harbour to the westward,
as Penlee Point does of what is technically called the
Sound. The extreme point of the Ram Head is laid down
in the best tables with <abbr title="latitude">lat.</abbr> 50° 18′ 52″ <abbr title="longitude">long.</abbr> 4° 12′ 29.″
In time 16<abbr title="minutes">m.</abbr> 50<abbr title="seconds">s.</abbr> west from Greenwich. The time
of high water at Plymouth dock yard at the new and full
moon is 3<abbr title="hours">h.</abbr> 33<abbr title="minutes">m.</abbr></p>

<p>As this is the point of land nearest to the Eddystone
lighthouse, it may be interesting to add, that the lighthouse
is distant from the Ram Head just 8¼ sea miles,
<!--382.png--><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376"></a><span class="pageno">376</span>
bearing about somewhat less than a point to the westward
of south, and from Looe Island 11½ sea miles bearing very
nearly south-east. <abbr title="latitude">Lat.</abbr> 50° 10′ 55″, <abbr title="longitude">lon.</abbr> 4° 15′ 3.″ In
time 17<abbr title="minutes">m.</abbr> west of Greenwich. The Eddystone rocks had
been for ages the dread of mariners; they lie nearly in the
direction of the line joining the Lizard and the Start, and
directly in the way of ships making Plymouth harbour
from the westward; their extent is moreover considerable,
reaching in one direction to about a mile, with only a
small rock appearing above the water.</p>

<p>The desire of a lighthouse was therefore strongly felt,
and at last, in the year 1696, Mr. Winstanley, of Littlebury
in Essex, undertook this arduous work, and completed
it in about four years; but Mr. Winstanley made his
wooden fabric of a large size, and of great height, trusting to
the tenacity of chains and iron rods for its support; not
having learnt from experience that those materials are incapable
of resisting, for any considerable time, the repeated
percussions of a tempestuous sea.</p>

<p>Mr. Winstanley himself happened to be there on the
26th of November, 1703, when the storm took place, which
is believed not to have been equalled since that time. On the
following day every thing had disappeared, with the exception
of two iron rods which were fastened in the rock, and
not a trace of the building was ever discovered.</p>

<p>Three years afterward, in the year 1706, Mr. John
Rudyard undertook to erect another light-house, undismayed
by the terrible catastrophe of the former; and this
gentleman adopted the correct principle of opposing the
impact of waves by the force of gravity, a power equally
constant, certain and stable, as that by which it is opposed.
He therefore constructed a plain framework of wood, nearly
cylindrical, with cross beams, and filled the whole with large
blocks of granite, leaving no more room than was requisite
for the lights, for the attendants, and for their stores; and
he made so rapid a progress as to display the light on the
28th of July 1708, and completely to finish the whole in
<!--383.png--><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"></a><span class="pageno">377</span>
the year following: notwithstanding that a French privateer
took off some workmen and their tools in the progress
of the work. But Louis the <abbr title="Fourteenth">XIV.</abbr> displayed on this occasion
the real spirit of generosity and honour, of which he
had endeavoured to support a weak resemblance throughout
his long reign. He ordered the workmen and their
effects to be restored, and committed to prison the persons
concerned in this unprincipled act publicly; declaring that,
although he was at war with England, he was at peace
with the human race, for whose common benefit such works
was constructed.</p>

<p>In Mr. Rudyard’s lighthouse the wooden frame was evidently
an imperfection. It must be liable to decay, and might
become the prey of flames. To obviate in some degree the
former defect, contrivances were adopted for shifting the
beams; but on the <abbr title="second">2d</abbr> of December 1755, after the work had
stood forty-seven years, the wood-work actually caught fire
and was entirely consumed. Boats were dispatched from ships
as well as from the shore, when the flames became visible,
which brought away the three men, who had used their
utmost endeavours, but in vain, to extinguish the fire. Fortunately
at that hour the tide was at its ebb, which allowed
the men to retreat sufficiently at a distance from the heat to
preserve their lives; two had received very little injury,
nor was the other apparently much hurt, but standing near
the foot of the building in front, and looking intently at the
flames as they issued through the top, he gave way to
an innate propensity, which anatomists have endeavoured
to explain by two tubes leading from near the palate to
the ear, by keeping his mouth wide open; when some
melting lead descended and passed down his throat, which
would otherwise have glanced from his skin without occasioning
the least injury. This man, although he had
advanced so far in life as to his ninety-fourth year, lived
several days, and without suffering much pain. After his
decease, a mass of lead weighing seven ounces, five drams,
and eighteen grains, little less than half a pound, was taken
<!--384.png--><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378"></a><span class="pageno">378</span>
from his stomach. See a communication by Mr. Edward
Spry, Surgeon of Plymouth, in the Philosophical Transaction,
<abbr title="volume forty-nine page">vol. XLIX. p.</abbr> 459, and <abbr title="volume ten page">vol. X. p.</abbr> 673, of the Abridgment.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this second disaster, the lessees under
the Trinity House were still resolved if possible to discharge
their duty. They applied in consequence to Lord Macclesfield,
then President of the Royal Society, who recommended
the most eminent of our civil engineers, with whom
no one can be thought to compare, excepting perhaps the
late Mr. John Rennie.</p>

<p>Mr. Smeaton was in consequence of Lord Macclesfield’s
recommendation applied to by the proprietors, and most
fortunately for mankind he undertook the work.</p>

<p>Mr. Smeaton adopted the essential principle of his predecessor
Mr. Rudyard, by opposing weight to the force of
the waves: but he made improvements in many respects,
by contriving a better figure, by more completely uniting
the work into one mass, and by discarding wood altogether.</p>

<p>The construction and the dimensions of every part are
given by Mr. Smeaton in an elaborate work with plates;
and it may be a sufficient recommendation to say, that the
greatest work of this kind executed since his time, and
by a most able engineer, that on the Bell Rock near the
Forth, is almost an exact copy of the Eddystone.</p>

<p>Mr. Bond, who visited the Eddystone on the 4th of
August, 1788, has given the following description of it in
his History of Looe, published in 1823.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Immediately opposite Looe church, fourteen miles off
and visible from the parade and hills, is the Eddystone
lighthouse, built by the late Mr. Smeaton of Yorkshire.
The lantern is an octagon of about nine feet diameter.
Till within a few years last past, it used to be lighted with
twenty-four very large candles, sixteen in one round frame,
and eight in another. Now Argand lamps are used, with highly
polished reflectors. The candle light was not frequently seen
from Looe by the naked eye: now the light is very strong,
and in dark nights does not appear above a league distant.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><!--385.png--><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379"></a><span class="pageno">379</span>
“At highwater the sea nearly embraces the base of the
building. You ascend to the door by a ladder on the outside,
almost perpendicular, according to my recollection,
about fourteen staves long. You then arrive at the stairs
within the building, which have, as no space can be lost, a
coal place under them. The first room you come to is
where the men keep their water, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>; the next is a store
room, where they keep their provisions, candles, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Round
the room is engraved, as in relief, “Except the Lord keep
the house, they labour but in vain that build it.” From this
room you ascend to the next, which is the kitchen, by a
ladder which goes up into a circular hole in the centre of
the room. A large copper cover, like that of a saucepan, is
placed to prevent falling through. You ascend to the next
room, which is the bed room, in the same manner, this
room is about twelve feet diameter. You next ascend in
like manner into the lanthorn, which has a seat round it.
Outside the lanthorn is a walk railed in round it. The
view from hence is singularly and awfully grand, and perhaps
has not its like. On the outside of the lanthorn are
engraved the cardinal points of the compass, and over the
door, “24th August, 1759.&mdash;Laus Deo.”</p>

<p>The village of Cawsand in this parish gives name to a
bay, which before the construction of the artificial reef,
afforded the only shelter in Plymouth Sound.</p>

<p class="p2 center smaller">THE MANOR OF REDRUTH,</p>

<p class="unindent">properly so called, which comprehends the town of the
same name, and part of the parish, but not entire, and
intermixed with several other gentlemen’s lands.</p>

<p>This manor is now divided between three lords, the
Right Hon. Henry Earl of Radnor, John Hawkins, D. D.
(by purchase lately from Francis Scobell, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> as heir of
Tredenham), and Reginald Haweis of Kelliow, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr></p>

<p class="p2 center smaller">THE TOWN OF REDRUTH.</p>

<p>This was formerly so inconsiderable as to be wholly past
in Mr. Carew’s Survey; who indeed is so much in haste in
the whole hundred of Penwith, that he seems to be like a
weary traveller, glad to come to his journey’s end. But
this town is of late years grown very considerable, and its
market the greatest in the West, especially for corn. It
owes its rise to the great confluence of people drawn together
by the mines of tin and copper, with which it is surrounded;
yet it must have been in former days of some
note, since in the reign of Edward the Third, William
Basset of Tyhiddy, got a patent from that king, to keep
“duo mercata” weekly, “et duas ferias annuatim” here.
But whether it did not turn to account, or however it was,
the market was neglected, and only the two fairs kept,
which still continue in that family.</p>

<p>John Buller, of Morval, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> being trustee for Francis
Basset, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> and finding such an old patent lying neglected
among Mr. Basset’s papers, (as I have heard the late Mr.
Basset often say,) took out a new patent from Oliver Cromwell
(which he got afterwards confirmed by King Charles
the Second), for one market weekly on Friday, and another
additional fair on &mdash;&mdash;. And the better
to colour the matter, [he] took it in the name of his nephew
Francis Buller of Shillingham, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> grandson to the above-mentioned
John Buller, in whom the whole estate is centred.</p>

<p>The town of Redruth consists chiefly of one large street,
<!--388.png--><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382"></a><span class="pageno">382</span>
near half a mile in length, and in it are several fair buildings,
the principal inhabitants being Mr. John Cock, Mr.
Anthony Cock, Mr. Paul Michell, Mr. Richard Banbury,
<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> many of which live upon their own land. At the bottom
of the great street, near the river, was the chapel, where
service was performed twice a week within the memory of
some living; but now it is unroofed, and the bell carried to
Trefusis, it lying in Mr. Trefusis’s land.</p>

<p>The family of Trengove, alias Nance, have several houses
and lands in and about this town, which being annexed to
their manor of Penwinnick and Melgisy, are now enjoyed
by Chester Nance, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>; as had likewise the family of Pendarves,
which were sold by Sir William Pendarves, not long
before his death, to Samuel Harris, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> of the family of
Park in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clement’s, whose son &mdash;&mdash; Harris now enjoys
them. So had too the family of Haweis, who are very
antient in the parish; and I have been told that Mr.
Haweis of Kelliow is descended from a younger son of this
family, but the eldest by a second marriage, to whom came
a third of the manor, and several good estates adjacent.
Their dwelling-house here, now turned to several tenements,
was sold about thirty years since to Mr. Richard
Remfry, by David Haweis, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> father to the present; and
his grandson, Mr. John Hussey, now enjoys it. John
Collins of Treworgan, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> hath likewise an estate here, and
was born in this town. The estate came by his mother.</p>

<p>Adjoining to the south of the town is</p>

<p class="p2 center smaller">THE MANOR OF TRERUFF.</p>

<p>Abundance of good tin and copper hath been lately dug
out of this manor, chiefly out of a mine called Pedenandre;
the present lord of which is Robert Trefusis, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr></p>

<p class="p2">Next is the <span class="sc">Manor of Tollgus</span>, which I take to signify
the hole in the wood, though there [be] but little [of
wood] there at present. [Toll-gus, like Tol-verne and Bar-gus
before, is Tol (C.) and Kuz (C.), the high wood. W.]</p>

<p><!--389.png--><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383"></a><span class="pageno">383</span>
The first place of note in it, is Treworthey, i. e. a house
on an hedge, suitable to its situation. This has been long
in lease, the seat of the Haweises, and is now so of David
Haweis, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> whom I could only wish male issue to, which
might inherit his many good qualities.</p>

<p>Next is Tollgus [itself], which gives name to the manor,
and was lately the seat of Richard Remfry, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> an eminent
attorney; who having buried his two sons (the eldest
of which, Henry Remfry, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> was a barrister at law),
left this to his grandson, by his eldest daughter, John Hussey,
<abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> who now enjoys it. This manor was anciently
Tregian’s, and came as you may see in Golden to Grosse,
and is now vested in John Francis Buller, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr></p>

<p class="p2 center smaller">THE MANOR OF TRELEIGH.</p>

<p>Id est, the dwelling place, lies adjoining to Tollgus, the
river only parting them. The barton hereof hath been for
three generations the seat of that most ancient family of
Pollard, being the chief stock from whence all the others of
that name were descended, which is now extinct by the
death of the late John Pollard, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> who died at his lodgings
in London, <abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr> 25, 1731, leaving only one daughter
Margaret, yet unmarried, having buried a few years before
two very hopeful sons, Hugh and John, both grown to men.</p>

<p>Yet I cannot leave this place without paying a due respect
to the memory of my deceased friend, and saying that
for quick natural parts, integrity, and true endeavours to
serve to the utmost of his power those whom he pretended
friendship to, he hath but few surviving equals. Some
time before his death he purchased the manor (which is but
a small thing) from Richard Erisey, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> whose family had
been [latterly the lords] of it, and their memory is still preserved
in a tenement in it called Park Erisey.</p>

<p>This barton hath produced of late years vast quantities of
tin and copper, though but little to the advantage of its
owner, who had the misfortune to have his good nature too
much abused by a parcel of villains he intrusted to his ruin.

To the south of Treleigh, are a long row of houses belonging
to the barton, on a level piece of ground called Plain
an Guary [a level for sports], from a round in the middle
of it for a public playing place.</p>

<p>The church lieth near a quarter of a mile out of the
town, at the very western extremity of the parish, with a
profitable glebe round it. In anno 1291, 20 <abbr title="Edward One">Edw. I.</abbr> (Tax.
Ben.) it was valued at 50<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> having never been appropriated.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The church of this parish stands about half a mile south-west
from the town, and is wholly modern; having been
constructed on the exact situation of the former, so as to
adopt its handsome and well-proportioned tower. The
new church was built about the middle of the last century,
when attention to propriety in adapting architectural designs
to their respective uses, civil or religious, seems to
have been at its lowest state of depression. This and the
church at Helston, constructed nearly about the same
time, present in the interior one large room, much more
resembling a gymnasium for training cavalry, than a place
for religious worship.</p>

<p>This parish, with Crowan and Lelant, are dedicated to
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Uny, or <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Unine, of whom nothing is known, and
therefore conjecture represents this saint as one of the missionaries
from Ireland. The advowson of the rectory is
appurtenant to the honor and manor of Tehidy, which has
been in the Basset family since early times of the Plantagenets.</p>

<p>In the town a chapel has very recently been built, probably
near to the spot where the one formerly stood, that
was dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Rumon, of whom little more is known
than of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Uny.</p>

<p>The abbey of Tavistock was dedicated to the honor of
Almighty God, in the names of the Blessed Virgin and of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Rumon, by Ordgar Earl of Devonshire, about the year
960, and confirmed by King Ethelred about twenty years
<!--391.png--><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385"></a><span class="pageno">385</span>
after. In Leland’s Collectanea de Rebus Britannicis, <abbr title="volume four page">vol. <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>
p.</abbr> 152, are noticed the following heads of a Life of Rumon:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Rumonus genere fuit Scotus Hiberniensis. Nemea sylva
in Cornubia plenissima olim ferarum. Sanctus Rumonus
faciebat sibi oratorium in sylva Nemæa Falemutha. Ordulphus
Dux Cornubiæ transtulit ossa Rumoni Tavestochiam.”</p>

<p>Doctor Butler says of this saint:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“William of Malmesbury informs us, that the History of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Rumon’s life was destroyed by the wars, a misfortune he
says that has also happened on other occasions in England.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“He was a bishop, although it is not known of what see;
his veneration was famous at Tavistock in Devonshire,
where Ordulf, Earl of Devonshire, built a church under his
invocation, before the year 960. Wilson, upon information
given him by certain persons of that country, inserted his
name on this day (January the 4th) in the second edition
of his English Martyrology.”</p>

<p>Since there seems to be very little probability in the supposition
that the name of this parish can have reference to
the Druids; and as two strong objections may be alleged
against its being derived from a ford of red water, from the
absence of any red stream, or ford; is it too hardy to conjecture,
that with variations in the orthography, and in the
pronunciation of the name, and perhaps with some adjunct
syllable, the long-sought-for etymology may be found in a
patron saint, when three other parishes, Ruan Major, Ruan
Minor, and Ruan Lanihorn, are dedicated to his name.</p>

<p>In consequence of the immense extension of workings on
lodes of copper all round the northern and eastern junctions
of the forest granite, with the killas or slate, the town
of Redruth has grown into a large size, and into considerable
opulence. The main street is rendered splendid on
both sides by continued lines of shops, and the market on
Friday is supplied in great abundance with every thing
that can be wanted in the ordinary concerns of life. Large
quantities of fish, of pork, and of home manufactures, especially
of shoes, are brought from Penzance market, held on
<!--392.png--><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386"></a><span class="pageno">386</span>
the preceding day, so that the road over Hayle Causeway is
thronged with carts throughout the intervening night; and
the long street of Redruth is scarcely adequate to contain
the people who come there from all these populous mining
districts, although a new and spacious market place has
been constructed within about thirty years, on the south
side of the main street, in which all the standings were
previously fixed. Much more recently a bell tower and
clock have been added, by the liberality of the late Lord
Dunstanville.</p>

<p>To the northward of Redruth, and running nearly parellel
with it, lies the village of Plengwary, a name undoubtedly
connected with the Amphitheatre or Round, which, till
within half a century, remained distinctly marked adjacent
to it. See Doctor Borlase’s Antiquities, second edition, p.
208; and his Natural History, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 297, and all that is stated
on this subject respecting the Round in Perran Zabuloe.</p>

<p>That gwary means a play or exhibition of games and
sports, cannot admit of a doubt. In Lhuyd’s Archæologia
Britannica, theatrum is rendered in Cornish guardy. But
Mr. Tonkin’s exposition of the first syllable, plan or plen,
by flat, level, is very doubtful, being founded perhaps on
no other basis than an accidental coincidence in sound with
an English word. This village, frequently called Little
Redruth, is not only grown into a town, but extends so as
almost to join the larger portion.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Memorandum.&mdash;In the year 1697 there was in Cornwall
<!--394.png--><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388"></a><span class="pageno">388</span>
a great dearth of corn. Wheat was sold at 39 or 40 shillings
per bushel (the treble Winchester bushel, or 24 gallons);
Barley at 28 shillings per bushel, on Saturday the 27th August,
at Helstone, being their market day. On the next market
day the barley was sold for 7 or 8 shillings per buhels.</p>

<p class="p2">This array was made three years subsequent to the
Cornish insurrection, when Michel Joseph and Thomas
Flammock led their followers to Blackheath in Kent.</p>

<p class="p2">Having omitted to notice in its proper place under
Illuggan, the very remarkable coincidence between the
measurements of former times and of our own, in respect
to the honor and manor of Tehidy, it will not be improper
to do so here.</p>

<p>The Cornish, in adopting the Saxon word acre (æcer)
applied it in the most extraordinary manner, either through
utter ignorance of its meaning, or from an absurd attempt
to designate by this term a previously existing measure of
their own, between two and three hundred times as large.</p>

<p>The Saxon acre in its true extent, was however adopted
afterwards in Cornwall, consisting of one hundred and sixty
square poles, each eighteen feet long. The Normans for
some reason quite unknown, reduced the length of the pole
from eighteen to sixteen feet and a half, and thus established
the difference between Saxon or customary, and
Norman or statute acres. They differ in the proportion
18 squared to 16½ squared, or as 12 squared to eleven
squared, that is as 144 to 121. As 6 to 5 for any approximate
conversion, and as 25 to 21 very nearly. This Saxon
acre continues, up to the present time, in very general use
throughout Cornwall, and is the measure by which woodlands
are estimated in most parts of England.</p>

<p>The absurdly denominated old Cornish acre, is believed
to contain 280 Norman acres.</p>

<p>Mr. Carew, <abbr title="folio">fo.</abbr> 46 of the original edition, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 131 of Lord
Dunstanville’s, gives the measurement in these Cornish
acres, of various manors and lands as they were returned
before the King’s Justices at Launceston, in the 12th year
<!--395.png--><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389"></a><span class="pageno">389</span>

<p class="unindent">and the manor extends into Crowan: so that if a nearer
coincidence were required, land might probably be found
there sufficient to complete the exact amount.</p>

<p>The abbreviation “Decunar.” stands in Mr. Carew’s list
before de Tehidi; but no word beginning with these letters
can be found either in Spelman’s Glossary, or in that of
Ducange.</p>

<p>It is impossible for me to turn away from this incidental
mentioning of Tehidy, without adding, that scarcely had the
press closed on the notes respecting Illuggan, containing a
most imperfect and inadequate tribute to the virtues, to the
manly character, to the liberality and steady private friendship
of its proprietor, then in a state of bodily affliction
demanding the commiseration of every one, when the final
scene of life came to an end, and he was no more. The
event took place on the 5th of February, 1835.</p>

<p>Lord Dunstanville now claims neither our commiseration
nor our pity: he has nobly performed the part assigned him
by Providence, and we doubt not is receiving the just
reward; but by an unanimous impulse the whole population
of Cornwall have resolved on recording to future ages,
not so much his merits, for that would be superfluous, as
their own high sense, consciousness, and estimation of them;
and not without the hope that such memorials may tend to
excite all persons in their different stations and degrees of
life to emulate examples so recorded. Meetings have in consequence
been assembled, and contributions made, amply
sufficient for placing a monument on Carnbre, a part of
Tehidy manor, and visible from the house; on a hill the
<!--396.png--><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390"></a><span class="pageno">390</span>
most romantic of any in the west of Cornwall, venerated as
a seat of the religion of our remote forefathers, and now
about to be truly consecrated by the spontaneous tribute of
a whole country, to the merits of a great and good man.</p>

tract on the south-eastern boundary; but all the remainder,
that is by far the greater part of the parish, is situated on

are very metalliferous, constituting, with similar rocks in
Camborne and Gwennap (all surrounding the same central

<p>Roach is situate in the hundred of Powdre, and hath
upon the north <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Wenn and Withell, east Luxsillian,
South <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell, West <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dennis. For the name, in
old Gaulish British it signifies a rock of stone, not unsuitable
to the natural circumstances of this place; where, on
a level piece of ground, stands the loftiest single ragged
rock this county can shew, at least thirty foot high, and by
it several other rocks of less magnitude.</p>

<p>In the Domesday Book, 20 William <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 1087, this district
was partly taxed under the jurisdiction of Tre-roach,
that is the rock town, now Tre-garrek, or Trecarrek, (i. e.
the rock town, also in Cornish,) the voke lands of the still
notable manor or lordship here so called; from whence
may be inferred, that before the Norman Conquest here
was an endowed rectory church, called Roch (i. e. Rock),
and the village adjoining, still Roach Town, and Roach
Church Town.</p>

<p>Moreover, in the inquisition of the bishops of Lincoln
and Winchester, into the value of Cornish Benefices, 1294,
Ecclesia de Rupe, in decanatu de Powdre, i. e. after the
Latin, the church of the Rock, or the Rock church, was
valued £6. 6<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 8<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span></p>

<p>In Wolsey’s Inquisition 1521, the rectory of Roach
was valued in £20. The patronage in coparcenary between
Arundell of Lanherne and Heart alternately, (by
a title derived from the heirs of De Rupes, or Roaches,

one year, 1696, £147. 13<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 6<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span></p>

<p>Moreover, in this parish, whereof I treat, upon the top
of the stony rock before mentioned, is still extant the moorstone
walls, durnes, and windows (the roof long since
<!--398.png--><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392"></a><span class="pageno">392</span>
dilapidated or demolished by time), an ancient chapel
for divine service; though now, by reason the old stone
stairs ascending thereto are pulled down by the tenants
of the manor aforesaid, and converted to common
uses, the access thereto is very difficult and dangerous.
The wall consists of about twenty feet in length, ten
feet in height, and about twelve in breadth; one part
of it is cut by art out of the natural rock, about thirty feet
high from the ground; the other part built of lime and
stone, so strong and curious, that neither time, wind, nor
weather can yet disfigure it. In its garret over, as appears
by the beam holes, there was formerly a lodge or planchin
(both which as aforesaid, long since, with the roof, are fallen
to the ground). In this chapel wall is towards the east a
large moorstone window where the altar stood, with a moorstone
door or durns on the south for entrance, and another
such door leading to the west, through which you are
brought out into a little garden plot and tye-pit on the
Rock, that overlooks the country many miles round. Who
built this chapel, whether the De Rupes, lords thereof, or
others, it is not recorded, nor at what time. But most
certain it is, that from this stone rock, the chapel, church,
and parish have the denomination Roach.</p>

<p>Mr. Carew in his Survey of Cornwall, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 139, (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 324
Lord Dunstanville’s <abbr title="edition">edit.</abbr>) tells us, that near this rock there
is another, which having a pit in it, containeth water, which
ebbs and flows as the sea doth. I was thereupon very
curious to inspect this matter, and found it was only a hole
artificially cut in a stone about twelve inches deep and six
broad; wherein, after rayne, a pool of water stands; which,
afterwards with fair weather vanisheth away and is dried
up; and then again on the falling of rain water is replenished
accordingly; which, with dry weather, abates as aforesaid
(for upon those occasions I have seen it to have water
in its pit, and again to be without it), which doubtless gave
occasion to the feigned report that it ebbs and flows as the
sea: of all which premisses thus speaks Mr. Carew further
out of the Cornish Wonder-Gatherer:</p>

<p>The last tradition of this hermitage chapel is, that when
it was kept in repair, a person diseased with a grievous
leprosy, was either placed or fixed himself therein, where
he lived till the time of his death, to avoid infecting others;
who was daily attended with meat, drink, washing, and
lodging, by his daughter, named Gunett or Gundred; and
the well hereby from whence she fetched water for his use
is to this day shown, and called by the name of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gunett’s

<p>Tre-Roach, alias Tregarreck, i. e. the Rock town as

<p>Hens, alias Hains Burrow, i. e. old ancient graves or

Austell, being the highest mountain or pyramid or promontory
of land in Cornwall, upon the top of which
unparalleled great tumulus or burying place was the Cornish
Avoh Bicken, becken, or beacon; that is to say, the signal,
the bakininge watchhouse, or proclamation house;
wherein, in times of war, one person was lodged to discover
the approach of enemies’ fleets of ships on the sea
coasts of Cornwall, and from this place he overlooked part
of the Irish sea, Atlantic ocean, and British channel; who,
accordingly on the discovery of enemies, was to set fire to
his little hut of combustible materials wherein he slept and
resided, to give notice, alarm the people, and to make signal,
beconinge, or proclamation, to all other bickens to do
the like. For heretofore every other parish in Cornwall,
upon the highest lands of their said parish, had one of
those bickens, beckeners, or beacons, for the same end and
purposes. Now those words bicken, becken, beacon, in
British, are synonymous, and signify to becken, cry out, to

Roche, born at Montpelier in France, of which city his
father was lord. After his father and mother were dead,
though but then twenty years of age, he took a resolution
to dispose of part of his estate, which he distributed amongst
the poor, left the administration of the remainder to his
uncle, and from a prince became a pilgrim. He took the
way to Rome, and both in his journey thither, and in that
city, cured several people of the plague, by making only
the sign of the cross. Being at last attacked by it himself,
he withdrew into a wood, where a neighbouring gentleman’s
<!--402.png--><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396"></a><span class="pageno">396</span>
dog brought him every day a loaf of bread; at last, being
cured, he returned to his own country, but it being in troublesome
times, he was taken up for a spy, and by his uncle
(who did not know him) shut up in prison, where he suffered
incredible evils; and dying there in 1327, he was at
last discovered by a writing found about him. The church
celebrates his memory the 16th of August. [But this parish
was called Roch before this saint was born, without the
addition of saint; for it is named De Rupe in Taxat. Ben.

<p>There being several manors in this parish, I shall begin
with one of the largest extent, royalties, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> the
manor of Tregarick, so called by corruption [rather by the
customary variation of a letter in composition, from carick,
a rock, the dwelling of the rock, as having in it the famous
great rock, which (as is said above) gave the name to this
parish. W.] This was antiently the seat of a family of the
<!--403.png--><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397"></a><span class="pageno">397</span>
same name, whose pedigree I have not been able to recover,
or to say any more of them, than that John Tregarrek was
knight of the shire, 7 Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>; [and that] the last of
them, &mdash;&mdash; Tregarick, left only one daughter and heir,
Matilda, married to Ralph Trenowth of Fentongollan, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>
anno &mdash;&mdash;, by whom she had only one daughter and heir
Johanna, who as being heir to her mother, carried this
manor to her husband, Hugh Boscawen of Tregothnan, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>
anno &mdash;&mdash; [about 1400, see Peerage.] Ever since which it
hath been in the possession of this family, the Lord Viscount
Falmouth being the present lord thereof.</p>

<p>[Authors cannot always draw conclusions from their own
premises: we have an instance of this here. The parish of
Roch has no relation to the noble pilgrim of France. It
was called Roch before this saint was born; and the
saint of the church was <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Conant, whose memory is still
preserved by his well on Trefrank, his park and meadow, corruptly
called <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gonnet’s. But this saint was afterwards
superseded by a more modern one, a nameless one, who,
actuated with the spirit of the pilgrim in France, renounced
the world, retired to this rock, built a small house of stone
upon a point at one end of it, and there spent his days in
hermetical devotions. The house is still entire in the shell
of it, having a small sort of common window at the outer
end of it, and a little flat for a garden upon one side; this,
from its proximity to the church and church town, was very
near to the haunts of men for a hermitage, but it was raised
upon a most extraordinary mass of rock, that here rises
upon the ridge of a heath in a rough and huge kind of
carcass, and spreads in its large limbs to a considerable
distance along the heath. On a tall and pillar-like spire of
this rock, ascendible only by a ladder, is the hermitage,
and the view from it must have been then, not much more
wild and savage than it is at present; the house and lands
of Tregarick being just under it. Indeed, the hermitage
must have been built by the family itself, as it is planted
upon their ground. Even one of the family I suppose was
<!--404.png--><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398"></a><span class="pageno">398</span>
the very hermit. Nor could it have been constructed for
this purpose at any period earlier than 1291, as appears
from the Valor of Edward, which calls the parish only
Roche, and knows of no saint of the name; the look of the
whole building, and the form of the window particularly,
concur to fix the hermit probably as late as the year 1400,
and to mark him perhaps for the last of the Tregaricks.
Deprived of all male issue, he perhaps grew disgusted with
the world, resigned up his mansion and his estate to his
daughter, and devoted himself for the remainder of his life
to poverty, to sequestration, and to prayer; and from the
natural tendency of mankind to revere those virtues of self-denial
and devoutness in others, which they are too gross
and too indulgent to practise themselves; he became
revered in his life, he was canonized after his death, and
the parish took its denomination from its native saint, its
saint of the rock, and its own <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Roche, preferring him to
its old saint, Conant, and for his sake attaching the name
of saintship to its old name of Roche. W.]</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Roach rock and tower are very conspicuous objects.
The tower, like some others in that neighbourhood, is lofty
and without pinnacles.</p>

<p>The rock is in itself the most remarkable object in all
that range of crystaline formations, and it is crowned by
the building described by Mr. Hals, which bears every
appearance of having been the cell of an anchorite, a Stylites,
or pillar saint, so far as this climate would admit. Mr.
Lysons, but without quoting any authority, says it was dedicated
to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael. Mr. Whitaker, clearly drawing on
the resources of his own fancy, has transformed Gunett or
Gundred, the traditionary daughter of the Leper who
retired to this place, into a masculine saint, whom he names
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Conant, and to whom Mr. Whitaker says, that not only
the hermitage but the church is dedicated.</p>

<p><!--405.png--><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399"></a><span class="pageno">399</span>
As Mr. Whitaker and Mr. Lysons have failed of producing
any document, or of alleging any tradition worthy of the
smallest reliance, it may fairly be concluded that nothing is
known with respect to the origin or specific use of this cell.
It may therefore have been constructed as they think, by
some proprietor of a neighbouring estate impelled by the
insane mythology then in fashion, for it cannot be called
religion; and afterwards, as appears to have been the case
in various other situations, it may have been used for a place
of penitentiary exile from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Petrock’s Monastery. Mr.
Lysons has given a perspective view, and an exact plan of
this building, accompanied by measurements, from which
it appears to be 14 feet 8 inches long, by 10 feet 6 inches
wide, and the wall about 2 feet 3 inches thick, except at the
south-eastern end, where the wall is laid down 3 feet
6 inches. No one can wish to see this building again
appropriated to its former superstitious purposes; but it may
be a fair subject of regret, that such a remnant of antiquity
should not be protected from injury by the addition of a
roof.</p>

<p>Mr. Treweeke, the incumbent mentioned by Mr. Hals,
was succeeded by Mr. John Tregenna, who held also the
rectory of Mawgan in Pider, and on his decease in 1754,
the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Samuel Furley was nominated by a Society in
London, who had purchased this and other livings, especially
in populous places, for the avowed purpose of inculcating
specific religious opinions. At Roach it is understood
that benefit has resulted to the inhabitants from these
appointments, and certainly no clergyman could be more
exemplary in the discharge of his parochial duties, or more
liberal in his conduct, than the able and intelligent individual
and excellent scholar who, to the regret of the whole
neighbourhood, has recently retired from the arduous care
of a flock, consisting chiefly of stream-work miners, the
least cultivated portion of a class of men, in general much
exceeding the average population of this kingdom in general
<!--406.png--><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400"></a><span class="pageno">400</span>
knowledge, and consequent good conduct, in relation to
their duties both in public and in private life.</p>

<p>Yet, notwithstanding this instance, the Editor cannot but
think that such a system of mortmain for making church
patronage permanently subservient to self-constituted bodies,
as the medium for giving currency to peculiar doctrines,
thus erecting mere wealth into an hierarchy as well as an
aristocracy in this kingdom, requires a prohibition from the
legislature; more especially as the desire and the zeal for
acquiring proselytes have been found in all times, in all
nations, and under every form of religion, not to bear a
very strict relation either to the soundness of doctrine, or to
the virtues such doctrine may be likely to produce.</p>

<p>It is clearly impossible that this parish can have been
dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Roche, since the name occurs in the Valuation
of Pope Nicholas made about the year 1291, where,
under the Deanery of Pouder, stands: Ecclesia de
Roupe, Taxatio, £6. 6<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 8<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> Decima, 12<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 8<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> while
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Roche is said to have died in 1327, forty-six years
afterwards; and if that were not sufficient, the name occurs
in the Domesday Survey made two hundred years before
the time of Pope Nicholas, and two hundred and fifty before
that of the saint.</p>

<p>The similarity of the sounds&mdash;parish of the Rock, and
parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Roche,&mdash;may have occasioned a subsequent
adoption of this saint: of whom it is stated, from the very
scanty materials remaining to make out his life, that having
left Montpellier, the place of his birth, to proceed on a
pilgrimage to Rome, he encountered the plague at the
city of Placentia; that not obtaining any assistance or
human help, after that most dreadful disease had manifested
itself on his person, he got into a wood where dogs miraculously
afforded him all the aid in their power, after a
manner suggested by the parable of Lazarus. Getting
well, he bestowed on others in the town that help which had
been refused to himself; and fully satisfied with this effort
<!--407.png--><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401"></a><span class="pageno">401</span>
on behalf of humanity, he returned into France, and spent
the remainder of his life in idleness and solitude.</p>

<p>He is fervently adored, and his aid entreated, over
France and Italy, as the individual to whom Almighty God
has delegated the care and superintendence of all cutaneous
complaints or exterior ulcers; and it is rather curious that
throughout Cornwall a congeries of pimples is denominated
a roach up to the present time.</p>

<p>This parish measures 6,080 statute acres.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>The grand geological feature of this interesting parish
is the large mass of granular shorl rock, which towers above
the adjacent country. It has all the appearance and form
(so far as regards the mechanical structure of this mass) of
a projecting tor of granite, such as commonly cap the most
elevated hills in Cornwall: but a nearer examination shows
that it is a compound of shorl and quartz. This rock is
entirely surrounded by a felspathic slate, being about a mile
distant from the granite. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mewan Beacon is an instance
of another large tor of shorl rock, a notice of which was
omitted under the head of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mewan; this rock differs
however from that of Roach in having a base of compact
crystalline quartz, throughout which the shorl is disseminated
in various proportions. Its position is also different,
for that rises immediately out of the granite.</p>

<p>The southern part of Roach parish reposes on granite;

<p>Is situate in the hundred of Powder, and hath upon the
north the river Vale, east Kuby, south Verian, west Egles
Ross or Philley. As for the first name, if it be compounded
of Ruan-Lawn-y-horne, it signifies the iron oak grove
rest, temple, or place of tranquillity and repose, referring
to the then natural circumstances of the place, heretofore
consisting of old decayed groves of oaks, whose withered
tops were like horne or iron: of which sort of timber Leland
in his Itinerary assures us the river Vale was surrounded.
But if Ruan be a corruption of, or derived from the Latin
ruina, ruinæ, it signifies woe, destruction, ruin, extreme
decay, death, misery, loss, falling down, danger, mischief.
Note also, that ruo is to fall, rush, run headlong with great
violence, to subvert, overthrow, beat down, batter, or destroy.</p>

<p>Probably at the time of the Norman Conquest this is

called Lary-horne, i. e. iron floor or ground church; perhaps
from the stone pavement of its floor.</p>

<p>Tregage, alias Tregago, alias Trejago, synonymous
words, a place that heretofore was the vokelands of a
manor or tithing: which place gave name and original to
an old family of gentlemen, from thence after the French
mode surnamed de Tregago, or Trejago, some of which
built Trejago house and castle, situate upon the vale, creek,
or river here, and yet extant in this place, in the reigns of
some of the first Norman princes.</p>

<p>Note further, that Jago, Gago, in the Scotts and Irish
tongues, signifies, as innis and insula, an island, in British
and Latin. (See Floyd’s Scotts-Irish Dictionary.) Also
that in this parish is the manor dwelling called Tre-lonk,
Tre-lonck, id est, the buttery or house that hath store of
food or provisions for housekeeping.</p>

<p>Ruan Lanihorne is in the hundred of Powder, and is
bounded to the west by Philly, to the north by the river
Fale, to the east by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cuby, to the south by Verian.</p>

<p>In anno 1291, 20 Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> this church was valued at
cvi<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> vii<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> having never been appropriated. As for the
adjunct of Lan-y-horne, or rather Hoarn, that is, the church
of iron, I believe it took it from the castle near it, as
being in those times a place of great note and strength with
this castle, than as being the principal place in this parish,
and the seat of the patrons, I shall begin with the description
of it; which, though more properly Lanyhorne Castle, was
commonly called Ruan castle: it stood by the south of the
church at no great distance from it, the rectory house being
<!--410.png--><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404"></a><span class="pageno">404</span>
between them, in a pleasant situation enough, on the edge
of a creek, into which a small rivulet empties itself; and the
river Fale, which is here of a considerable breadth, when
the tide is in, and surrounded formerly with woods, which
are now mostly destroyed. Leland gives account of the
state of it in his time: “from Tregony to passe doune by
the body of the haven of Falamuth, to the mouth of Lanyhorne
creeke or hille, on the south-est side of the haven, is
a 2. miles. This creeke goith up half a mile from the
principale streame of the haven. At the bed of this creeke
standith the castelle of Lanyhorne, sumtyme a castel of
8.  tourres, now decaying for lak of coverture; it longgid
as principal house to the Archedecons. These landes
descendid by heires general to the best Corbetes of Shropshir,
and to Vaulx of Northamptonshir. Vaulx part syns
bought by Tregyon of Cornewaul.” By this one may
guess what a stately castle this formerly was; for in my
time was only one tower of the castle standing, which was
so large, that if the others were equal to it, the whole building
must be of a prodigious magnitude; but I fancy this
was the body of the whole, for there is not room enough
about it for so great a pile: so that I believe the eight
towers mentioned by Leland were only turrets and appendages
to this principal part. I wish I had taken a draught
of it in season (as I often intended); for this too was pulled
down in or about the year 1718, by Mr. Grant, who having
obtained leave from the lord to do it, erected several
houses with the materials, and turned it into a little town,
to which ships of about 80 or 100 tons come up, and supply
the neighbourhood with coals, timber, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> as the barges do
with sand. But since the writing of this, I am informed
that six of the eight towers were standing within these thirty
years, of which that which I have mentioned, was the
biggest and loftiest, as being at least fifty feet in height.
This belongs to the manor of Elerchy, of which I have
given a full account in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Verian, in which the place which
gives name to it is seated, though the castle was no doubt
<!--411.png--><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405"></a><span class="pageno">405</span>
the chief seat of its lords. Thomas Le Archideakene was
one of those that had £20 of land or rent or more, 25th

33 Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> and the 6th, 7th, and 8th, of Edward <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>;

Lord Hobart, as heir to Sir J. Maynard; the incumbent,
Mr. Canon Grant, who succeeded in 17&mdash; Mr. John Dell,
as he did his father Henry.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The parish church is situated on a creek flowing into the
Tregony branch of the Falmouth River, and has the
appearance of much antiquity. When Mr. Tonkin wrote,
about a hundred and thirty years ago, vessels of a size sufficient
for enabling them to navigate the open sea, came up
this creek; but in common with many other similar estuaries,
it has become filled up with alluvial detritus from above,
and no longer admits even barges.</p>

<p>Near to the church stood a large and magnificent castle
flanked by eight towers, the residence of a very ancient
family bearing the name of Arcedekne.</p>

<p>Of this family, Thomas le Arcedekne was summoned to
Parliament as a Baron, in the 14th year of Edward the
Second, <abbr title="Anno Domini">A. D.</abbr> 1321, as was his son John le Arcedekne, in
the 16th year of Edward the Third. This last Baron left
a son Warine le Arcedekne, who died, leaving three
daughters his coheirs. The arms of this family are stated
by Mr. Lysons to have been Argent, three chevronels
Sable.</p>

<p>Of these daughters, Alice became the wife of Walter de
Lacy; and her coheiresses married into the families of
Corbett and Vaux. The portion of Vaux having been
forfeited, was given in 1462 to Avery Cornburgh, and
afterwards belonged to the unfortunate Mr. Tregian. On
<!--412.png--><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406"></a><span class="pageno">406</span>
the plunder and confiscation of his property, it was purchased
by Mr. Ezekiel Grosse.</p>

<p>The manors of Lanihorne and Eleskey belong to Mr.
and Mrs. Gregor, and Mr. Lysons adds, that they were
formerly held of the honor of Launceston, by the annual
render of a brace of greyhounds.</p>

<p>Treviles was the seat of the Lukes, of whom William
Luke, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> held the situation of an admiral.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitaker has added to Mr. Tonkin’s manuscript a
history of this parish, sufficient in quantity to make a volume
of itself, therefore much too long for a portion of this work;
and of which the Editor would not attempt to make an
abridgment, since the style discriminates its author, and
the detailed quotations from writers little known to the
generality of scholars, evince his learning and profound
research. Perhaps this example of parochial history may
appear at some future time in a substantive form; but
whenever that is done, an addition must be made to it of
the most interesting and most important circumstance connected
with this parish:&mdash;the life of Mr. Whitaker himself.
It will therefore be sufficient to state here these short
particulars.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Whitaker was born in the year 1736, at
Manchester; this naturally induced him to write the
history of that town, a work which raised its author to a
considerable elevation in literary fame. He became a Fellow
of Corpus Christi College in Oxford, and retired on
this living acquired for the college by purchase from the
Earls of Buckinghamshire, heirs of Sir John Maynard.</p>

<p>Soon after Mr. Whitaker’s arrival in Cornwall he married
a lady, heiress of the Tregennas, a family long distinguished
in Cornwall, and known throughout England by
the fame of one of its members, a lawyer, a wit, and a man
of letters, in the reign of Charles the Second.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitaker died in November 1808, aged 73, and is
buried in the chancel of the parish church with this simple
memorial:</p>

<!--413.png--><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407"></a><span class="pageno">407</span>
<div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">John Whitaker, B.D. Rector.</div>
  <div class="i0">Buried <abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 14th, 1808, aged 73.</div>
</div>

<p>He left two daughters, one of whom is married to Richard
Taunton, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> M.D. through whose kindness and liberality
Mr. Hals’ manuscripts have been placed in the Editor’s
hands for publication.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitaker stands deservedly high in the estimation
of the whole literary world, as a man of superior talent, and
as an able and brilliant writer in the various departments of
theology, politics, biography, general history, and topography;
besides these, he has left sermons and opuscula,
which, collected from the British Critic, and from similar
repositories, would fill several volumes, all able, but strongly
marked by impressions indicating the predominance of
fancy, and of an unshakeable determination to support every
opinion once entertained, without any reference to the
solidity of the foundation on which it may repose; thus
stamping a character of dogmatism, which in theological
works would seem to be far better suited to a Church claiming
infallibility, than to one owing its very existence to
appeals made from authority to the exercise of private
judgment.</p>

<p>In biography Mr. Whitaker, carried away by imagination
and feeling, has wasted the powers of his mind to “make
the worse appear the better reason, to perplex and dash
maturest counsels,” in an elaborate and learned effort to
vindicate the character of one among the most unprincipled
and abandoned females recorded in history, because she
was beautiful in her person, and finally paid the forfeit of
her crimes in a manner perhaps too protracted and informal,
and because the blind chance of birth had placed her in the
highest political office of her native country.</p>

<p>The following extract from a manuscript of undoubted
authority, is given to prove how easily men of the greatest
genius may deceive themselves in antiquarian researches,
more especially when plausible theories are adopted, and
then maintained, on the fallacious evidences of doubtful
<!--414.png--><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408"></a><span class="pageno">408</span>
expressions used by obscure writers, immured perhaps
within the walls of cloisters, or removed to considerable
distances, both of time and space, from the scene of occurrences
pretended to be described, and at periods of our
civilization, when no intelligence was circulated, and when
the transit of a few miles equalled the fatigue, or exceeded
the danger, of modern journeys into distant climates.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitaker has printed two volumes in quarto on the
Ancient Cathedral of Cornwall. One great object of this
work, replete like all the others with the most extensive
miscellaneous learning, is to prove that no Bishop’s see
ever existed at Bodmin, and the assertion is maintained
with much vehemence of expression, and disregard of
individuals the most respected. Even Doctor William
Borlase, whose name is consecrated among his countrymen
as their boast and their pride, does not escape from
invective and contemptuous epithets, for having maintained
the affirmative in regard to the existence of this see.</p>

<p>The Reverend Josiah Forshall, late Fellow of Exeter
College, and now Keeper of the Manuscripts in the British
Museum, has had the goodness to favour me with the
following communication.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="blockquote">[The Volume from which the following entries are
taken, is a copy of the <a href="#Gospels">Four Gospels in the Vulgate
Version</a>, formerly belonging to the Church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Petroc, and probably at an early period one of its
chief treasures. It appears to be of the Ninth Century,
and would perhaps by some critics be assigned
to a still more remote date. The ornaments of the Ammonian
Harmony prefixed, of the initial capitals, and
of a page which is found immediately before the
Gospel of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John, are rude and curious, and
strongly resemble those which are to be met with
in very ancient <abbr title="manuscripts">Mss.</abbr> executed in Ireland. The
volume is in quarto, of rather an oblong form, and
<!--415.png--><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409"></a><span class="pageno">409</span>
is very neatly written, though evidently by a scribe
not well informed or of great learning even for those
times. It was purchased by a London Bookseller
at the sale of a private library in Oxfordshire, about
three years ago, and soon afterwards sold to the
British Museum, where it is now deposited and
designated by the No. 9381. The entries seem to
be contemporaneous with the manumissions which
they record.]</p>

<p class="center"><span class="title">Bishops of Devonshire.</span></p>

<p class="p0">Werstanus, or Adulphus, consecrated 905, died 906: his
see was at Bishop’s Tawter.</p>

<p class="p0">Putta, murdered by Uffa, the King’s Lieutenant.</p>

<p class="p0">Eadulphus, brother to Alsius, Duke of Devonshire and
Cornwall, was installed Bishop of Devonshire, at Crediton,
<abbr title="Anno Domini">A. D.</abbr> 910.</p>

<p class="p0">Ethelgar was Bishop from 932 to 942.</p>

<p class="p0">Algarus, died in 952.</p>

<p class="p0">Alfwaldus, (recommended by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dunstan) died 972.</p>

<p class="p0">Alwolfus, sate nine years.</p>

<p class="p0">Alfredus or Alfricus, Abbat of Malmesbury, died 999.</p>

<p class="p0">Alwalfus.</p>

<p class="p0">Eadnothus.</p>

<p>Livingus, Abbat of Tavistock, was consecrated Bishop
of Crediton, 1032. He was the nephew of Burwoldus, the
last Bishop of Cornwall, upon whose decease the Bishopric
of Cornwall was added to the see of Crediton.</p>

<p><!--422.png--><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416"></a><span class="pageno">416</span>
Leofric, the last Bishop of Crediton, obtained from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Edward, to transfer the see of the united Diocese to Exeter.</p>

<p>There is extant a very curious reason assigned by King
Edward the elder, for an endowment of these manors on
Eadulphus, made Bishop of Crediton in 910, not very
flattering to the see of Cornwall.</p>

<p>Ruan Major is situate in the hundred of Kerryer, and
hath upon the north and west Mullyan and Cury, east <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Kevorne, south Ruan Minor.</p>

<p>Partly in this parish stands the barton of Erisey or
Herisey; from this place was denominated an old family of
gentlemen surnamed de Erisey, now in possession thereof,
<!--423.png--><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417"></a><span class="pageno">417</span>
who have flourished there in worshipful degree for many
generations; and particularly George Erisey, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> was
sheriff of Cornwall, 4 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> 1514; also the present
possessor, Richard Erisey, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> son of James Erisey of
Brickleigh in Devon, by &mdash;&mdash; Dowrige, was sheriff of
Cornwall the 7th of William <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>: he married &mdash;&mdash; sister
and coheir of George Killigrew of Arwinick, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>
(son and daughter of Sir Peter Killigrew, Baronet) by whom
he had issue one only daughter named &mdash;&mdash;; which
lady and her said daughter, after some years’ cohabitation
with Mr. Erisey, upon some discontent eloped from him,
and by no entreaties could be persuaded to a reconcilement
or return to her said husband, or to restore his daughter on
her begotten, to his possession, which she kept with her;
whereupon, in the year 1701, Mr. Erisey brought down a
trial at law against Mr. Lister, cognominatus Killigrew, his
brother-in-law, before Mr. Justice Blencowe at Lanceston,
who then also lodged and detained his said daughter from
him; upon which trial at the crown bar, Mr. Killigrew
aforesaid and his niece appeared, when it was manifested
to the court that he laid no restriction upon the young
lady; but, if she would, she might at any time go to her
father’s house; yet her eloped mother so influenced her,
that the judge nor court could not prevail with her to do it,
though her father Mr. Erisey was then and there also in
court ready to receive her with tears, she being the heir-at-law
both to his and much of her grandfather Sir Peter
Killygrew’s lands; so that from Lanceston she went again
to her mother, with the said Mr. Lister Killygrew, and
was afterwards married to one captain or colonel West, a
soldier of fortune, by whom I hear she had two daughters
now living; after which she died, her father and mother
living in a separate state as aforesaid: of which gentleman,
Mr. Erisey’s vexation and trouble for the loss of his wife’s
company, I am informed its parallel to that of Hector’s,
whom Homer makes thus to speak.</p>

<p>From whence it appears that Homer and Hector thought
a good and righteous marriage the only happy state of
human life; for a good, faithful, and loving wife brings up
the husband’s children in order, governs his family, saves
his substance, rules his house as well as increases his
offspring, with the greatest faithfulness and integrity.</p>

<p>And if any charge or labour happen, for no state of
human life is without a cross, verily this only is that light
burden and sweet yoke which is found only in honest wedlock:
especially if the wife be such as Hector’s was, in whom
no avarice, nor pride, nor deceit, nor covetousness, nor
fraud, was found that joined them together.</p>

<p>One of those Eriseys dancing with other gentlemen and
ladies at Whitehall, before King James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> through the
violent motion and action of his body in the middle of the
dance, had his cap slip from his head, and fall to the
ground, but he instantly with his foot tossed it on his head
again, and proceeded without let or hindrance with his
part in that dance, to the admiration of all that saw it,
which gave occasion to King James to inquire who that
active gentleman was; and being told that his name was
Erisey, he forthwith replied, I like the gentleman very well,
but not his name of Heresy. The arms of Erisey are in
a field Sable, a chevron between three griffins segreant

<p>At the time of the Norman Conquest, this district was
taxed under the jurisdiction of Lizard or Lizart. In the
inquisition into the value of Cornish benefices by the Bishops
of Lincoln and Winchester 1294, this church was
not extant or endowed; though before Wolsey’s Inquisition
1521, it had revenues by the masters or governor of
St John’s Hospital at Sithney, or the Carmenows of Carmenow,

<p>There does not appear to be any thing demanding particular
notice in this parish. The family of Erisey were
seated here from remote antiquity, on a manor and barton
of the same name. Mr. Lysons states that the mansion
house was rebuilt about the year 1620; and that the family
became extinct in 1722, when their estates passed with an
heiress to Col. John West, and since by purchase to the
Boscawens of Tregothnan.</p>

and hath upon the north Ruan Major, east <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kevorne,
west Grade, south the British Ocean or Channel. In the
Domesday Book it was taxed under the jurisdiction of

extant. In Wolsey’s Inquisition 1521, it was valued at

<p>In this parish at Cadgwith, i. e. war-tree, so called in
memory of some war or battle heretofore fought near
some tree then extant in this place, is the dwelling of
George Robinson, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> that married three wives, Trevillian’s
widow, Tregose, and Penhallow; his father Thomas
Robinson, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> a Commissioner for the Peace in the interregnum
of Cromwell, that lived at Helston, was there, as
he was walking in the fields where his cows depastured,
casually assaulted with his bull, who, though at other times
was a creature very gentle and quiet by nature, at that time
put on an unusual ferocity, without any provocation or
distaste given him from his master, that he instantly left his
fellow creatures, and ran towards Mr. Robinson, and gave
him many dangerous wounds in his body by pushing at
him with his horns, and at length cast him up into the air,
from thence whereby he fell to the ground several times to
his greater hurt, till at length by those violent tossings of
his body, his hat flew from his head on the ground, and
<!--428.png--><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422"></a><span class="pageno">422</span>
was driven thence by the force of the wind to the surface
of the earth, to some distance, which the enraged bull
observing, pursued after it, and tossed the same into the air
with his horns several times after, which gave Mr. Robinson,
then comparatively dead on the ground, opportunity
to get to the stile of the field, and to crawl over it into
another close, by which means, and the help of others, he
got alive to his house, in order to cure his wounds, but
maugre all endeavours of physicians and chirurgeons, his
wounds and bruises were so deep and mortal, that in three
or four days after he died.</p>

<p>Various were the sentiments of the neighbours upon this
sad accident. But I shall shut up this history in the words
of our Saviour, on other such sad accidents amongst the
Jews: saying, “Think ye that those sixteen on whom the
tower of Siloham fell, or those whose blood Pilate mixed
with their sacrifices, were sinners above all men? I tell you
nay, but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish, for
secret things belong only to God.”</p>

<p>The arms of Robinson are, in a field Vert three bucks
in full course, armed and attired Or.</p>

<p>Note further, that all those twelve parishes commonly
called Meneage, the outmost south-west part or point of
Cornwall, in the Domesday Book of William the Conqueror,
are all comprehended or taxed under the name of
Liz-ard, which signifies in British the lofty or dangerous
gulf or flux of waters, as the same is, and over a strag or
promontory of ragged rocks running for about half a mile
out into the sea from the land, visible at low water, but not
at full sea or half flood, which hath occasioned the destruction
or wrecking of many ships, and loss of many men’s
lives and goods, who either in the night storms, or
through ignorance, have chanced to sail over it, and are
wrecked between the strait of those rocks, and the furious
meeting or flashing of the waves of the sea.</p>

<p>Hence also from the word liz, which signifies a hazardous
gulph of water between two lands, rivers, or arms of
<!--429.png--><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423"></a><span class="pageno">423</span>
the sea, we have Tre-liz-ike, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Earth, and Padstow harbour,

<p>Ruan Minor joins with Ruan Major, which lies to the
north of it, to the west and south with Grade, to the east
with the Channel. This parish has the same patron and
incumbent as the former, and is valued in the King’s Book,
£4. 4<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 5<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> [It was originally, no doubt, a mere chapel to
Ruan Major.]</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The only place in this small parish requiring the least
notice is Cadgwith or Cagewith, a moderately sized fishing
cove, and heretofore celebrated for its lucrative trade, while
the rights of the duchy were practically maintained against
the admission of all coercive laws, relative either to the
Customs or to the Excise.</p>

<p>The principal part of this parish anciently belonged to
the distinguished family of Carminow.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons says, that on the partition of their property
between heiresses, the lands in Ruan Minor were allotted
to Trevarthian, whose heiress brought them to the Reskymers,
who had them in 1620; they were afterwards in the
Bellots, of whom the property was purchased by Robinson
of Nanceloe, and alienated from them to an adventurer
called Fonnereau, who having obtained a seat in Parliament,
procured a lucrative bargain for constructing lighthouses on
the Lizard Point. Having ultimately become a bankrupt,
or died insolvent, every thing that he had purchased was
again sold, and the lands in this parish were bought by the
late Sir Christopher Hawkins, about the year 1780, and
they now belong, under a special devise, to his brother’s
second son.</p>

The advowson of the rectory was reserved in the sale by
Robinson.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons records one of those singular customs in
ecclesiastical matters which arose in former times out of
the capricious fancies of individuals making gifts for the
salvation of their souls. It seems that the rector of this
parish sends a horse into a certain field in the adjoining
parish of Landewednack, whenever a harvest of corn is
taken in it, for the purpose of bearing home as many
sheaves as the horse can carry on his back.</p>

<p>This parish is the only one west of Hayle that does not
reach the sea shore.</p>

<p>There is little remarkable about the church and tower,
although they are pleasing objects in various directions.
The church contains monuments to some former vicars,
and also to Mrs. Bird. This lady was the only daughter
of Mr. William Wayne, a gentleman brought from Bristol
to instruct the newly established copper smelting company
at Hayle, in the requisite branches of metallurgy. He married
in Cornwall, and his daughter succeeded to a portion
of the very considerable property left by Mr. Abell Angove
of Trevenson.</p>

<p>Miss Wayne was born at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Erth in 1762, married Mr.
Bird a gentleman of Devonshire in 1785; and having become
a widow, died near Plymouth in 1803, without leaving
any family. Several of her maternal relations had
been buried here.</p>

<p>The great tithes belong to the Chapter of Exeter, who
are patrons of the vicarage, which is endowed with the lordship
of a manor.</p>

<p>This parish has to boast of a consecrated well, efficacious
for restoring health to children, and indebted for its virtues
probably to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> <a name="chg_7" id="chg_7"></a>Enny, as the remains of a chapel dedicated
to that saint are near the well,</p>

<p>Mr. Hals has a long dissertation on the various creeds
professed at different times in the Christian church, and
fancies that this <a name="chg_8" id="chg_8"></a>house may indicate an assumption by the
inhabitants of the one most holy of all. This is omitted.
<!--433.png--><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427"></a><span class="pageno">427</span>
It seems, however, to be worth remarking, that all the people
of the county used to pronounce the word san-crist;
and this, joined with the fast of the parish feast being
celebrated, not in honor of any particular saint, but at
Whitsuntide, may be sufficient for suggesting a query at
least, whether the church is not really dedicated to the
Saviour of Mankind.</p>

<p>Drift in this parish, was formerly the residence of the
Trew-rens, or more probably Tre-wren, which is said to
mean the fair and handsome town. The family removed
to Trewardreva in Constantine, and Drift was sold about
sixty years ago, by the last Mr. Trewren.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">HALS.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Sennen is situate in the hundred of Penwith, and hath
upon the north <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just, south <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Levan, east Buryan,
west the Land’s End and the Atlantic Ocean. As for the
name, if it be compounded of Sen-nan, it signifies the holy
valley; but most likely the name is derived from the tutelar
guardian and patron of this church.</p>

<p>At the time of the Norman Conquest this district was
taxed under the jurisdiction of Buryan, on which it is still
dependant in spirituals as a daughter church. And if this
church were extant, and endowed at the time of the first
inquisition into the value of Cornish Benefices 1294, it then
was rated also under Buryan. Lastly, this parish was
rated to the four shillings per pound Land Tax 1696, at
£57. 12<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 0<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> by the name of Sennan.</p>

<p>Upon view of this church 1700, the sexton shewed me
the headless bodies of some images of human shape cut in
alabaster, that were not long before found hid in the walls
of the same, all curiously wrought, which also had been
painted with gold, vermillion, and blue bice, on several
parts of their garments. He also shewed me an inscription
on the foot of the font stone, which he told me several Bishops
of Exeter and their priests, in their triennial visitations at
Buryan and this church, had viewed and inspected, but
could not read it; whereupon, in like manner, I observed
on the font-stone the said inscription in a barbarous strange
character or letters, of which I could see but part, by reason
a new pew or seat was built on a part of it; however, I
interpreted that which I saw to consist of these letters,
Anno <abbr title="Domini 1420">Dom. mille <span class="muchsmaller">CCCCXX</span></abbr> or <abbr title="40"><span class="muchsmaller">XL</span></abbr>, in the year of our Lord
1420 or 1440. Let the curious remove the seat and explain
the rest; probably this church was then erected.</p>

At Pen-ros in this parish, i. e. the head of the valley,
near some high promontory of lands, is the dwelling of
Henry Jones, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> some time Commissioner for the Peace
and Taxes, who married Tonkyn of Newlyn.</p>

<p>Trevear in this parish, i. e. the great or greater town, is
the dwelling of John Ellis, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> Attorney at Law, who
married &mdash;&mdash; Davies, and giveth for his arms in a field
Argent, three eels Proper, after the English, out of a supposed
allusion to the name Ellis; whereas, ellis, elles, in
British, is a son-in-law by the wife; and els, ells, a son-in-law
by the husband. And as gealvy is an eel fish in Scotch
and Irish, so malsay is an eel in Welsh British. See
Floyd, page 218; and sleane is a conger fish in Cornish;
and lilly, silli, is an ele or eele, in that language. See
Floyd on Anguilla.</p>

<p>This parish affords very little wheat corn, by reason it is a
naked country exposed to the wind and sharp air of the sea
in winter season, which washes or frets the same out of the
ground at that time, unless it stands in the valleys or close
places between the hills against the south or east; nevertheless
it is abundantly supplied with barley corn, the soil
producing, generally, with little husbandry or cultivation,
twenty Cornish bushels in most acres; that is to say, about
sixty Winchesters.</p>

<p>In this parish is situate the most remote north-west
promontory or head-land of the Island of Great Britain,
where it is not above an arrow’s flight breadth (at the end
thereof), the lands naturally or gradually declining from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Just, and Chapel Carne Braye, four miles distant, to this
place, and the sea at least eighty fathom under those places;
where, as it were in a low valley, it meets the waves of the
Atlantic Sea, or West Ocean, and parts some of the Irish
Sea and British Channel asunder by its horned promontory
of land; which shows that opinion and tradition of the
lands extending further west of old towards Scilly, to be a
vulgar error and a fable; for if it had stretched more
<!--436.png--><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430"></a><span class="pageno">430</span>
westerly than it doth in this lower valley, and no higher
pitch or degree, the flux and reflux of the sea or tides
would inevitably overflow it. Or had there been any considerable
parcel of ground there broke off from the insular
continent of Britain, (as tradition saith the country of
Lioness was,) by some inundation, earthquake, or accidental
concussion, it must have been much higher land than the
contiguous country of the Land’s End is. Otherwise it
could not exist there as aforesaid; but it is not likely there
was ever any such land, since no fracture or disjointing of
the earth appears on the confines or summit thereof.</p>

<p>Though at low water there is to be seen far off towards
Scilly, (probably so called from the abundance of eel or conger
fishes taken there, called sillys or lillis,) for a mile or
more a dangerous strag of ragged rocks, amongst which the
Atlantic Sea, and the waves of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George’s and the British
Channel meeting, make a dreadful bellowing and rumbling
noise at half ebb and half flood: which let seamen take
notice of, to avoid them.</p>

<p>Of old there was one of those rocks more notable than
the rest, which, tradition saith, was ninety feet above the
flux and reflux of the sea, with an iron spire at the top
thereof, which was overturned or thrown down by a violent
storm 1647, and the rock broken in three pieces. This
iron spire, as the additions to Camden’s Britannia inform
us, was thought to have been erected there by the Romans,
or set up as a trophy there by King Athelstan when he first
conquered the Scilly Islands (and was in those parts); but it
is not very probable such a piece of iron in this salt sea and
air, without being consumed by rust, could endure so long
a time. However it is or was, certain I am it commonly
was called in Cornish, An Marogeth Arvowed, i. e. the
armed knight; for what reason I know not, except erected
by or in memory of some armed knight; as also carne-an
peul, id est, the spile, spire, pole, or javelin rock. Again,
remember silly, lilly, is in Cornish and Armoric language
<!--437.png--><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431"></a><span class="pageno">431</span>
a conger fish or fishes, from whence Silly Islands is probably
denominated, as elsewhere noted.</p>

<p>This place is called by the Welsh Bards Pen-ryn-Pen-wid,
that is to say, Penwith Hill Head Tree, or the hill of
the Head Tree, or Penwith Cantred. By the Cornish
Britains, Pedn-an-lase, i. e. the Green Head or Promontory,
and by others, Antyer Deweth, the Land’s End.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>This parish takes its name from its tutelar saint <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Sennan,
or Sinninus, an Irish Abbat, who (saith Leland) was
at Rome with <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick, and came over from Ireland to
Cornwall with <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Breage. The church hath dedicated the
30th of June to his memory. It is a daughter church to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Burien, and is valued, together with that and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Levan,
in the King’s Book, at £48. 12<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span></p>

<p>[The passage alluded to above as in Leland, is this, and
in <abbr title="Itinerary Three">Itin. III.</abbr> 15, “Breaca,” he says, out of a Life of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Breage which he met with in Cornwall, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“venit in Cornubiam,
comitata multis Sanctis; inter quos fuerunt Sinninus
Abbas, qui Romæ cum Patritio fuit.”</span>]</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>This parish is greatly distinguished as being the most
western in England, and containing within it the promontory,
which, without reference to the cardinal points, evidently
terminates the granite chain, which stretching out
from Dartmoor, extends by links, apparent at intervals
at the surface, to this point, the most distant on the continent
of England. The same range appears again in the
Scilly Islands, and it may possibly join the similar granitic
districts in France.</p>

<p>It is a very curious circumstance, that, notwithstanding
the great numbers of square leagues composed entirely of
<!--438.png--><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432"></a><span class="pageno">432</span>
granite in Cornwall and in Devonshire, that magnificent
rock never appears in the cliff except for a few miles on
each side of the Land’s End; but there it is seen piled in
high masses one on the other, which, coupled with the
great Atlantic swell of the waves, present a general effect
the most magnificent that can well be imagined. And
what adds still more to the grandeur of the scene, about a
mile from the extreme point, a lofty range of rocks, called
the Longships, rises out of the sea. On the most elevated
point of this rock a light-house was constructed about fifty
years ago, nearly after the model of Mr. Smeaton’s building
on the Eddystone; this column has the advantage, however,
of standing at a great height above the water, so as,
perhaps, never to receive an actual blow from the most violent
wave; yet so tempestuous is the sea, that for three
months together all communication has been intercepted
between the lampmen and the shore.</p>

<p>The latitude and longitude of the Land’s End appear,
from the Trigonometrical Survey, to be, latitude 50° 4′ 7″;
longitude 5° 41′ 32″; in time 22<abbr title="minutes">m.</abbr> 46<abbr title="seconds">s.</abbr> west from Greenwich.</p>

<p>The church of this parish is a very conspicuous object in
every direction. It is on the usual plan of churches in this
district, and is built of granite with a granite tower. In it
are some monuments, particularly to the Ellises, who have
relinquished the three eels mentioned by Mr. Hals as an
armorial bearing, and instead have sculptured on these
stones the blazon appropriated to the name throughout
England, Argent, on a cross Sable five crescents of the
Field.</p>

<p>The church town has a pretty good inn, capable of
affording entertainment, and even beds to parties<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">Led by the fable of Belerus old,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or the Great Vision of the Guarded Mount.</div>
</div>

<p>This inn is distinguished by a sign bearing two inscriptions
suited to its peculiar situation. Travellers proceeding
<!--439.png--><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433"></a><span class="pageno">433</span>
to the Land’s End, find the board inscribed with these
words,</p>

<p class="indent3">The last public house in England;</p>

<p class="unindent">returning, they see on the other side,</p>

<p class="indent3">The first public house in England.</p>

<p>About half a mile further eastward than the church
town, is a village called Mean, probably from the great
number of large rocks interspersed among the houses. In
the very midst of the village is a large flat rock, on which
three kings are reported to have dined together at some
remote period; and a prophecy of Merlin is added to the
tale, that a larger number of kings will be assembled round
this rock for the same purpose previously to some great
catastrophe, or to the destruction of the world itself.</p>

<p>Not far from Mean is Whitsand Bay, from whence
Athelstan is said to have embarked for the Scilly Islands,
and to have landed on his return. King Stephen is also
said to have landed here; and King John on his return from
Ireland; and lastly, Perkin Warbeck; but various other bays
have derived a similar name from their white sands, and
therefore the honours bestowed on this remote and dangerous
cove may be very doubtful.</p>

<p>Mr. Hals has adverted to the fertility of this parish, and
noticed the production of twenty Cornish bushels, equaling
sixty Winchester bushels, of barley on one acre. The
parish certainly is very fertile, being situated on granite
peculiarly abounding in felspar; but the Cornish acre, derived
from the Saxon pole of eighteen feet, exceeds the
Norman acre in the proportion of six to five, therefore the
produce is reduced to fifty bushels.</p>

<p>It is much to be lamented that a variety of measures
should remain in different parts of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>In Ireland the pole is 21 feet. Their mile consists, like
our own, of 320 poles, but of course exceeds our measure
in the proportion of 21 to 16½, or as 14 to 11.</p>

<p><!--440.png--><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434"></a><span class="pageno">434</span>
The Irish acre, like our own, contains 160 square poles,
but exceeds it in the proportion of 21 squared to 16½
squared, or as 14 squared to 11 squared, as 196 to 121, as
13 to 8 very nearly.</p>

<p>The patron saint selected for this parish by Mr. Hals,
is stated to be a Persian of that name, who was seized at
Babylon, and delivered to the fury of wild beasts at Rome,
which, as in the case of Daniel, became mild and abstained
from hurting him; but here the parallel ends, for Valerianus,
instead of acknowledging the God of one so miraculously
preserved, ordered gladiators immediately to kill
the saint, and they obeyed. Reference is made to the
Agonal of Baronius; but this saint is little known in England
or by English writers.</p>

<p>A much more likely patron may therefore be discovered
with Mr. Tonkin, in another <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Senan, of whom Dr. Butler
gives the following account:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Senan, Bishop and Confessor, was born in the
county of Hy-Conalls in Ireland, about the latter part of
the fifth century, and was a disciple of the Abbots Cassiolus
and Natal or Naal. He then travelled for spiritual improvement
to Rome, and thence into Britain. In this
kingdom he contracted a close friendship with <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> David.
After his return to Ireland he founded many churches;
and a great monastery in Inis Cathaig, an island lying at
the mouth of the river Shannon, which he governed, and
in which he continued to reside after he was advanced to
the episcopal dignity. The abbots his successors, for
several centuries, were all bishops till this great diocese
was divided into three, namely, Limerick, Killaloe, and
Ardfert.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Senan died on the same day and year with <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> David;
but he was honoured in the Irish church on the 8th of
March. A town in Cornwall bears the name of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Senan.
See his Acts in Colgan, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 602.”</p>

<p>The Persian saint is said to be honoured on the 30th of
July in the Greek church, so that the parish feast, which is
<!--441.png--><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435"></a><span class="pageno">435</span>
kept on the nearest Sunday to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Andrew’s day, has not
any reference to either of the supposed patrons.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DOCTOR BOASE.</p>

<p>This parish, like the last, rests only on granite; at low
water, however, some felspathic rocks may be seen.</p>

<p>The granite exhibits the common varieties of this part of
Cornwall, and is traversed by porphyritic beds; one of
which at Mean is a compound of granular felspar and
shorl in various proportions. This kind is of rare occurrence;
it is traversed by veins of quartz, which are occasionally
much intermixed with shorl; this mineral also
abounds in the adjoining granite, but more particularly in
the veins by which it is traversed.</p>

<p>Whitsand Bay is covered with a testaceous sand like that
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, of Padstow, and of other places on the north
coast; a large tract of this sand is exposed at low water to
the action of the wind, by which it has been drifted in considerable
quantities inland so far as Sennen Green.</p>

<p>At the time of the Norman Conquest this district was

<p>This church was founded and endowed by those knightly
gentlemen, lords of the barton and manor aforesaid, surnamed
Daunye or Dawney. Mr. Carew tells us in his
Survey of Cornwall, that the funeral monuments of two of
those knights are yet extant in this church, though the
inscriptions about them are worn out by time. Certes,
this was a very famous and flourishing family on the barton
of Shevyock aforesaid, for several descents, till the time of
King Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> when the sole daughter and heir of Sir
John de Dawney, knight, named Emelyn, was married to
Edward Courtenay, 11th Earl of Devon, 1380, by whom
he had issue Edward Courtenay, surnamed the blind, the
12th Earl of Devon, and Sir Hugh Courtenay of Haccomb,
knight; the which Edward, at the request of his said
mother, by his deed bearing date the <abbr title="second">2d</abbr> of King Henry
Fifth, settled upon the said Sir Hugh Courtenay his brother,
the manors of Gotherington, South Allington, and
Stancomb Dawney in Devon, which were the lands of her
ancestors the Dawneys. Afterwards, the said Edward died,
7th Henry <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> 1418. (See Brooke in his Catalogue of Devon
Earls.)</p>

<p><!--443.png--><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437"></a><span class="pageno">437</span>
By this Emelyn Dawney, as traditions amongst the
family of the Courtenays have it, Boconock came first into
their tribe, though others say that it came to Sir Hugh
Courtenay of Haccomb, by Lerchdeacon’s heir, but more
truly that his said mother settled it upon him on his marriage
with Lerchdeacon of Haccomb’s heir.</p>

<p>One Nicholas de Dawney, 3 Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> held in the hundred
of East, by the tenure of knight service, two knight’s
fees and a half. (Survey of Cornwall, page 41.) Of the arms
of those gentlemen thus speaks Nicholas Upton in his Latin
manuscript, before printing was invented 1440. Monsieur
Gwilliam Dawney port d’Argent, oue trois popinjays en
bend oue deux cottises. Again, Monsieur John Dawney
port d’Argent, en une bende Vert trois rose de Or, oue
deux costs de Azure; from whence I infer there were
either several families of those Dawneys, that gave different
arms, or that in those days they had no positive record of
their bearings.</p>

<p>One Sir John Dawney, <abbr title="knight">knt.</abbr> of Cowick, in Yorkshire,
Sheriff of that county 35 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> gave for his arms, in
a field Argent, on a bend cottised Sable, three annulets of
the Field, which is the recorded arms of Dawney.</p>

the exterior does not possess any beauty, and the whole is
disfigured by an irregular truncated pyramid adjoined to
the western end as a tower. Within, the church is neat
although it is unusually small, but containing a series of
splendid monuments, ancient and modern.</p>

<p>Mr. Carew says, “The next parish on this river (the
Liner) is Sheviock, some time the ancient Daunyes’ inheritance,
by whose daughter and heir the same (together
with other fair possessions) descended to the Earls of Devon.
In the church there lie two knights of that name,
and one of their ladies by her husband’s side, having their
pictures embossed on their tombs in the side walls, and
their arms once painted round about; but now, by the malice,
not of men, but of time, defaced. They are held to
be father and son; and that the son was slain in our wars
<!--445.png--><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439"></a><span class="pageno">439</span>
with France, and was from thence brought home to be here
interred;” but Mr. Lysons conjectures that one of those
monuments is to a Courtenay.</p>

<p>“There runneth also a tale amongst the parishioners,
how one of the Daunyes’ ancestors undertook to build the
church, and his wife the barn adjoining; and that, casting
up their accounts upon finishing of their works, the barn
was found to have cost three halfpence more than the
church: and so it might well fall out, for it is a great barn,
and a little church.” The advowson belongs to Mr. Carew’s
descendant, the <abbr title="Right Honorable">Rt. Hon.</abbr> R. P. Carew, of Anthony.</p>

<p>The barn, or what remains of it, almost adjoining to the
church, adds to the very singular appearance of the whole
group. Scarcely any remains of the mansion house, the
residence for several ages of a family so distinguished as the
Dauneys, can now be discovered.</p>

<p>The principal village in this parish is Crofthole, situated
on what was till very lately the turnpike road from Tor
Point to Leskeard, and just at the point where the road
branches off to Looe and Fowey.</p>

<p>This village stands nearly on the brow of a lofty cliff, down
which the road to Looe descends by repeated turnings. Mr.
Lysons says the ancient name was Croftilborowe, and that
it possessed a weekly market on Wednesdays, granted to
Nicholas Dauney, then Lord of Sheviock, with a Fair for
three days at the Festival of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James. The market has
long been discontinued. The village is at this time far
from large, or from presenting any appearance of opulence.
Mr. Carew says it then contained but twelve dwellings, and
adds one of those coarse tales, which are usually applied as
jokes against any small place, endowed with privileges
or immunities above what its importance would seem
to justify.</p>

<p>On the edge of the sea, nearly under Croftshole, is a
small pier protecting a narrow beach of sand between
rocks, called Porth Wrinkle: it gives shelter to fishing
boats and small vessels. The ancient pier, which had stood
<!--446.png--><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440"></a><span class="pageno">440</span>
during a great number of years, was destroyed by the
violent storm of <abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 2, 1822. It is however replaced.</p>

<p>Trethil belonged for some time to the family of Wallis.</p>

<p>The family became represented by two brothers<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>John Wallis, who had an only daughter married to
Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth; and Samuel Wallis,
Captain in the Royal Navy, the celebrated circumnavigator
and discoverer of Otaheite. This gentleman
married Miss Betty Hearle of Penryn, and has also left an
only daughter, now the widow of the late Samuel Stephens,
<abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> of Tregenna in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives. Most of the recent monuments
are connected with this family.</p>

<p>Sheviock measures 2122 statute acres.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">HALS.</p>

<p>Sithney is situate in the hundred of Kerrier, and hath
upon the north Crowan, east Helleston and Gwendron,
south the Loo Pool and British Channel.</p>

<p>In the Domesday Book 1087, this district was taxed
under the jurisdiction of Trew-thall or Truthall. In the
Inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester 1294,
into the value of the Cornish Benefices, Ecclesia de Sancti
Sithany, in decanatu de Kerryer, was rated at £6. 6<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span>

<abbr title="four">iiii</abbr><span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> In Wolsey’s Inquisition 1521,
it was valued to first fruits £19. 11<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span>
4<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> The patronage
formerly in the master or governor of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John the Baptist’s
Hospital in this parish, who endowed it, now in the
Bishop of Exeter; the incumbent &mdash;&mdash; Hawkins; the rectory
in possession of &mdash;&mdash; Paynter; and the parish rated
to the four shillings per pound Land Tax, 1696, £147. 9<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span>
by the name of Sithney.</p>

<p>In this parish at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s formerly stood an hospital,
commandery, or preceptory, dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John
Baptist, and distinguished by the name of the Hospital
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John the Baptist of Jerusalem, for Christians
that were sick or wounded in the war; also for entertainment
of Christian pilgrims and travellers that came to
that city. This hospital of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s in this parish was
subject to the master of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s Hospital in London, as
all other in England were, and was valued at the suppression
thereof 26 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> at £12. 6<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 8<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> saith Dugdale,
£14. 7<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 4<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> Speed. This sum it seems was the value of
their rents on leases, so what their domains were I know
not.</p>

<p class="unindent center">Here the MS. is again deficient.</p>

<p>However, those who pretend to skill in taste and palate
<!--448.png--><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442"></a><span class="pageno">442</span>
eating, prefer the saltwater trout before this Loo trout;
nevertheless, I take it to be a fish of good taste and digestion,
and when killed in his proper season not inferior in
redness to the sea-trout; this pool on the one side being
situate on Mr. Penrose’s lands, hath entitled him to free
fishing therein time out of mind.</p>

<p>But the absolute royalty and jurisdiction of this river
pertained to the ancient earls now dukes of Cornwall, or
to the kings of England, in right of their adjacent manor
of Helleston in Kerryer; and for further proof thereof, I
will give an ancient testimony out of the pleas of the Crown
in the Exchequer 12 Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 1282, (See also Blount’s
Ancient Tenures, from thence, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 52.) where we may read
these words.</p>

<p lang="la" xml:lang="la">Wilhelmus de Trevelle tenet unam acram terræ Cornubiensem,

venerit apud Hellestone, et quamdiu moram ibi fecerit.</p>

<p>From whence I conclude that this William de Trevelle
either had or was keeper of the royalty of this lake or pool
by inheritance, and held one Cornish acre of land in Eglesderry,
that is to say, one hundred and eighty English acres
by the tenure of Sergeanty for that purpose, and providing
a fishing hook or iron crook and a net, as long as the king
should stay or tarry in the manor of Helleston, fishing or so
doing. This Degemue and Eglesderry are lands in the
manor of Helston Chaumond in Kerrier. This name and
tribe of Treveale are still extant in Roach and elsewhere
in Cornwall.</p>

<p>Sithney is in the hundred of Kerrier, and is bounded to
the west by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Breage, to the north by Crowan, to the

<p>I shall begin with</p>

<p class="p2 center smaller">THE MANOR OF PENROSE.</p>

<p>The head of the valley [or rather, the Hill of the Heath,]
which hath given a name and dwelling to a very ancient
family, seated there (it is said) before the Conquest.</p>

<p>It is pleasantly seated on the side of the Looe Pool, which
for the most part belongs to it, of which Mr. Carew (<abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr>
152) thus, “Under it (Heilston) runneth the river Lo, whose
passage into the sea is thwarted by a sandy bank, which
forceth the same to quurt back a great way, and so to make
a pool of some miles in compass. It breedeth a peculiar
kind of bastard trout, in bigness and goodness exceeding
such as live in the fresh water, but coming short of those
who frequent the salt. The fore-remembered bank serveth
as a bridge to deliver wayfarers, with a compendious passage,
to the other side; howbeit sometimes with more haste
than good speed, for now and then it is so pressed on the
inside with the increasing river’s weight, and a portion of
the outer sand so washed down by the waves, that at a sudden
out breaketh the upper part of the Poole and away
goeth a great deal of the sand, water, and fish, which instant,
if it take any passenger tardy, shrewdly endangereth
him to flit for company, and some have so miscarried.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“To this Pool adjoineth Mr. Penrose his house, whose
kind entertainment hath given me and many others experience
of these matters. He married the daughter of
Rashleigh. He beareth, Argent, three bends Sable,
charged with nine roses of the Field.” But before I leave
the Loo Pool, I must observe that the name of the river
<!--450.png--><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444"></a><span class="pageno">444</span>
is taken from the Pool, for such are called Loghs or Los in
our ancient tongue. Neither is the bar which forms it of
sand; but Leland gives this account of it (Itin. <abbr title="volume eight folio">vol. VIII.
fol.</abbr> 3), “Lo-Poole is a two miles in length, and betwixt it
and the mayn se is but a barre of sande; and ons in three
or four years, what by the wait of the fresch water and rage
of the se, it brekith out, and then the fresch and salt
water meting makith a wonderful noise; but soon after the
mouth is barred again with sande. At other tymes the superfluitie
of the water of Lo-Poole drenith out through the
sandy barre unto the se. If this barre might be alway
kept open, it would be a goodly haven up to Heilston.
The commune fische of this Poole is trout and ele.”</p>

<p>The present lord of this manor is Edward Penrose, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
who is yet unmarried. He succeeded Robert Corker, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
on his death, A.D. 1731, as receiver of the duchy of Cornwall,
and is in the Commission of the Peace and Lieutenancy.
His father, Edward Penrose, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> was a very worthy
good-natured gentleman, and was likewise a Justice of
the Peace. He married &mdash;&mdash;, the daughter of James
Praed, of Trevetho, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> by whom he had also one daughter
&mdash;&mdash;, married to James Keigwyn, of Mousehole,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> and since dead without issue. His grandfather Richard
Penrose, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> was Sheriff of Cornwall 17 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr></p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>There is not any thing remarkable about this parish
church; it is distant no more than a mile and quarter
from Breage Church, but divided from it by a deep valley,
which runs down to Porthleaven, heretofore a small fishing
cove, till some projectors induced credulous persons to contribute
large sums of money, for the purpose of making a
harbour for vessels at this place, under the vague pretence
of saving human life, a matter on which all mankind are
agreed, but without being able to show that their plans
would have that effect: assuming it, however, they had the
<!--451.png--><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445"></a><span class="pageno">445</span>
hardihood to solicit from Parliament an impost on all vessels
passing within a certain distance of the Land’s End and
the Lizard. Several tens of thousands of pounds have
been expended on this senseless undertaking, which has
utterly failed of its object, and made the small harbour less
commodious for boats than it was before.</p>

<p>The principal seat in this parish is Penrose, the residence
for centuries of a very ancient family bearing the same
name, till the heiress of Penrose married Pearce of Penryn,
and their only daughter married Alexander Cuming, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>
from Scotland. They parted with this property to Mr.
John Rogers of Helston, younger brother of Mr. Hugh
Rogers of Treasow in Ludgvan, to whom he ultimately succeeded.</p>

<p>Mr. John Rogers left an only son Hugh Rogers, Sheriff
of Cornwall in the year 1770. This gentleman married
Ann, daughter of Mr. James of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Columb. They also
left an only son Mr. John Rogers, member of Parliament
for West Looe and for Helston: he married Margaret,
eldest daughter of Francis Basset, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> of Tehidy: and died
the <abbr title="twenty-second">22d</abbr> of February, 1832, leaving a very numerous family.
He is succeeded by his eldest son the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Rogers,
Canon Residentiary of Exeter, and Rector of Mawnan.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Rogers added very considerably to the
property purchased by his grandfather, more especially on
the sales by the Arundell family; so that the Penrose
domain now extends round the Lake, and affords a scope for
improvements, which may convert this place into one of the
most beautiful in Cornwall, and such are expected from the
talents, liberality, and taste of the present opulent possessor.</p>

<p>Antron appears to have been a place of consequence in
former times. Mr. Lysons says that it belonged to an
ancient family of the same name, from whom it passed with
an heiress in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, to the Paynters;
that it was purchased of them by the Hoblyns in
1670, and sold by the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Robert Hoblyn, to John Rogers,
<abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> late Captain in the Naval Service of the East
<!--452.png--><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446"></a><span class="pageno">446</span>
India Company, who restored the place by building a new
house, and by other improvements. It now belongs to
his son.</p>

<p>Trevarnoe was purchased by the late Mr. Christopher
Wallis, a gentleman who made a large fortune in Helston
and in this place, by the practice of the law. He had an
only daughter, married to Captain Popham, a brother of
the adventurous navigator who distinguished himself at
Buenos Ayres. Their son now resides here; he served
the office of Sheriff in 1834, and has married a daughter
of the late Sir Vyell Vyvyan, of Trelowarren.</p>

<p>Very little is known about the hospital of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John in
this parish. The following short notice is all that occurs
in Dugdale’s Monasticon:</p>

<p>“Helston.&mdash;Leland, in his Itinerary, mentions an hospital
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John yet standing at the west-south-west end
of the town of Helston, of the foundation of one Killigion
or Killegrew. It is mentioned in the Register of Edmund
Stafford, Bishop of Exeter (from 1395 to 1419)
<abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 135. In the 26th of Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> the total revenue of
this hospital amounted to £14. 7<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 4<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> The net receipts to
£12. 16<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 4<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> per annum.” At the foot of the hill, and on the
south side of the road leading from Mirazion, just as it
turns almost at a right angle, is a large stone placed upright,
bearing in relief the sword of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John, having its
guard in such a position as to represent the potence of a
cross; and this stone is believed to point out very nearly
the site of the ancient hospital.</p>

<p>The great tithes of this parish were appropriated to the
monastery of Glaseney, near Penryn; they have since the
reformation passed through different hands, and belong to
Sir Samuel-Thomas Spry, M.P. for Bodmin, son of the
late Admiral Spry.</p>

<p>The present incumbent is the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Samuel Cole, <abbr title="Doctor of Divinity">D.D.</abbr>
Chaplain General to the Navy. About a century ago this
living was held, together with Phillack and Gwithian, by
the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Edward Collins, the Editor’s great-grandfather.</p>

<p>This parish extends from near Wendron Church almost
to the Loo Bar, in the form of a long stripe running a
little west of south; rather more than a quarter part of
this stripe, at its northern extremity, rests on granite; all

<p>The arms of Pye are, Argent, on a fess Azure three
escallops of the Field.</p>

<p>Lastly, in this place, to refresh the tired reader, I will
recount a story of the unfortunate amours of John Tanner
aforesaid, with his lady Madam Windham, to whom
he made his first addresses of marriage, and after some
time good liking fell deeply into each other’s affection; but
the conditions of marriage proposed by Mr. Tanner not
being hastily agreed upon by her father Mr. Windham,
gave opportunity to Charles Speccott, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> a gentleman of
much greater estate than Mr. Tanner had, to make an
overture of marriage to the lady aforesaid, together with a
larger settlement in jointure than Mr. Tanner was able to
grant or perform; which proposals were forthwith accepted
by Mr. Windham, so that he soon after constrained his
daughter, notwithstanding what amours had passed between
her and Mr. Tanner, to marry Mr. Speccott.</p>

<p>At the news of which cross accident, Mr. Tanner, her
former inamorato, was so discontented and perplexed in
mind, that in order to quiet his disturbed soul, and obliterate
or extinguish the memory of this beautiful woman (for such
she was), he forsook this land and travelled into France.</p>

<p><!--456.png--><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450"></a><span class="pageno">450</span>
In brief, Tanner, having been eighteen months in France,
notwithstanding the variety of faces and company he met
with, grew there also discontented with himself, and a
continual impulse lay upon his spirit which he could not
suppress, that he must return back again into England, for
what reason he knew not; whereupon he went on board a
ship, and came safe into the port of London, where he had
not remained scarce ten days before he heard of the news
of Mr. Speccott’s death within that time; upon which intelligence
he forthwith posted from London to Thornbury in
Devon, where she then resided in a mourning state, who
received him in such joyful and welcome manner, that soon
after the marriage was concluded betwixt them, by whom
he had a great estate as aforesaid,</p>

<p class="p2 center smaller">THE MANOR OF BRANNEL.</p>

<p>In Carew, (<abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 47), in the extent of Cornish acres, Beranel
is valued in thirty-six, the 12 <abbr title="Edward One">Edw. I.</abbr></p>

<p>I take this to be the same which is called in Doomsday
Book Bernel, being one of the manors given by William
the Conqueror to Robert Earl of Morton, when he made
him Earl of Cornwall,</p>

<p class="p2 center small">WHITAKER.</p>

<p>There is a very striking singularity in the nature of the
present parish, which is but slightly or hardly noticed, by
Mr. Tonkin. It has been taken out of the parish of Carhayes,
and yet is actually distant from it. It is considered
as one living with Carhayes, and yet has Probus and Creed
in a first line, Tregony and Cuby in a second, Veryan and
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ewe in a third, successively coming betwixt Carhayes
and it. It is now held with <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dennis as its daughter, and
Carhayes as its mother, by a clergyman who holds Boconnock
and Braddock as one church, together with it; and
who therefore stands forward to the curious eye, a most
singular instance under the present forms of ecclesiastical
law, of one man lawfully possessing five churches. But
how is all this phenomenon in parochial formations to be
accounted for? It can be accounted for, I think, only in
this manner. The manor of Carhayes was originally a
royal one, I suppose. The house was therefore the seat
occasionally of our Cornish kings. It was a seat peculiarly
frequented, I also suppose, for the sake of the adjoining
forest of Brannel. And the donation of Brannel by William
the Conqueror to Robert Earl of Morton, when he
made him Earl of Cornwall, proves it to have been in the
hands of the Crown at the time, and intimates it to have
been a part of the Cornish demesnes originally. The
lands that had belonged to the Cornish Crown, would certainly
<!--458.png--><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452"></a><span class="pageno">452</span>
be attached to the English, on the suppression of
kings, and would assuredly be conferred on the Earldom of
Cornwall, when the Kings were succeeded by Earls. In
this condition of the parish and the forest, when the latter
was annexed to the house, and so became a part of the
former, any house that was raised in the forest for the
temporary reception of the king, was necessarily considered
to be as much in the parish as it was in the manor. When
other houses were built, and a perpetual inhabitancy took
place in them, a chapel was naturally erected for the
participation of the inhabitants in divine offices, and the
rector of Carhayes was called upon to officiate in person or
by proxy at it; in person while the king was there, by
proxy when he was not. And he had the tithes of this
newly cultivated part of the woodland, to repay him for his
trouble or his expense. This accounts satisfactorily, I
think, for the strange extension of the parochial compasses
here. One leg was centered at the house of Carhayes, and
therefore the other stretched over all the intermediate
regions, and took its footing on the woodland of Brannel
beyond. Nothing but the regality of both could have permitted
such a vast stride as this. A Neptune may stalk
from promontory to promontory, and a king may take a
colossal step from Carhayes to Brannel. The very name
too seems to concur with all this: called Bernel, Beranel,
and Brannel, and originally belonging to the crown, it
speaks the royal relationship at once; Brenhin, or Brennin
(W.) being a king, brennyn, brein, brenn (C.) royal, Bran
being the Welsh name for the famous Brenhind (W.) and
consequently brennol (C.) once, being kingly or royal.
The house also at Carhayes has a royal kind of appearance
with it, being built in the old style of grandeur round a
court having a chapel, a wall, and all the uncomfortable
vastness of a princely house. In this manner did <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s
go on to form a new kind of parish, by encroaching
upon the royal woodland, and peopling these gloomy
deserts. Considered at first as a chapelry to Carhayes, it
<!--459.png--><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453"></a><span class="pageno">453</span>
was valued with it in 1291. It afterwards became parochiated,
and is valued as a distinct parish in the Valor
of Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>; but before the period of this second
Valor, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dennis, which was wholly unknown in 1291,
had risen upon <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s, just as <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s had risen
upon Carhayes before. The daughter of Carhayes thus
became a mother to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dennis; and the wildest and
remotest part of this antient forest of our kings coming to
be peopled, and requiring a church for its inhabitants, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Stephen’s stands in the new Valor, accompanied with its
chapel of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dennis.</p>

<p>N. B. The only variation from the account here given,
is what a sight of Pope Nicholas’s Valor has suggested to
me. There Caerhayes is not mentioned at all. The only
church noticed is “Ecclesia Sancti Stephani.” This, therefore,
included Caerhayes, then the larger included the
smaller; and Caerhayes, which is little more (I believe) as
a parish, than its own demense and park, (which, as royal
demesne, I suppose, was not parochiated,) became annexed
to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s, when this was parochiated,&mdash;when, therefore,
the royal relation of both had ceased; and was so
annexed in the Valor of 1291. June 16, 1794.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>This parish, like the other dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen,
has a lofty tower placed, with the church, in a position
commanding the adjacent country, which retains, however,
much of its former character; yet cultivation is gradually
extending itself here, as in other wild tracts of Cornwall,
through the medium of potatoe cultivation; but if the mines
should fail, or if the system itself goes to a great extent, we
have a tremendous example before our eyes of the inevitable
consequences resulting from this subdivision of property.</p>

<p>The church contains but one monument of any curiosity,

<p>It may be remarked, that the increase was rather more
in the first twenty years, an anomaly in all likelihood occasioned
by the fluctuation in mining concerns, and to the
preparation of China clay having reached its limit.</p>

<p>If the increase had uniformly continued for a century at
this rate, the population at the end of that time would
reach the great number of 14,635.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DOCTOR BOASE.</p>

<p>A line drawn <abbr title="Northwest">N. W.</abbr> and <abbr title="Southeast">S. E.</abbr> about a mile due <abbr title="North">N.</abbr>
from the church, would divide this parish into nearly two
<!--461.png--><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455"></a><span class="pageno">455</span>
equal parts, the northern parts consisting of granite, and
the southern of schistose rocks, belonging to the porphyritic
series.</p>

<p>The granite stretches completely across the large central
mass of this district, and contains many varieties. Next to
the slate, the rock generally contains a considerable portion
of shorl, which sometimes takes the place of the mica
altogether; both of these kinds abound in large veins and
courses of quartz and shorl rock. But the most abundant
variety is that extensively decomposed into a white friable
mass; of this substance the more compact and perfect parts
are quarried, and exported under the name of China stone,
whilst the earthy parts are washed to separate the fine
argillaceous particles from the grains of quartz, and from
other hard minerals with which they are mixed in their
natural state. The water, rendered white like milk by this
operation, is received in large pits, where the earthy part
subsides, and then after being dried is sent to the potteries
under the name of China clay. The manipulations which
this substance undergoes during its preparation are simple,
but very tedious; and they afford employment to several
hundred persons. The extent of this branch of commerce
is so great, that about seven thousand tons of clay,
and five thousand tons of China stone are exported from
Cornwall every year, of which by far the greater part is
raised in this parish.</p>

<p>The rocks of the slate series are similar to those of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Mewan and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell, containing also metalliferous veins.</p>

of East, and hath upon the north Werrington, east the
Tamer river, south Launceston, west <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas.</p>

<p>At the time of the Norman Conquest, this district (in the
Domesday Book 1087,) was taxed under the jurisdiction of
Lan-san, or Lan-sen, i. e. signifying a holy church or temple,
though at that time this superior church had in this
place a famous collegiate church dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen,
consisting of secular priests, who might marry wives,
founded and endowed by the Bishops of Bodman, and
Earls of Cornwall, long before William the Conqueror’s
days. Reginald Fitz-Harry, base son of King Henry <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> by
Anne Corbet, created Earl of Cornwall by King Stephen,
in the 5th year of his reign 1140, was a great benefactor to
this collegiate church; and besides all that, endeavoured
with all his power and interest with King Stephen to bring
back the bishopric of Cornwall, transferred or translated
to Kirton and Exeter, and fix the bishop’s see and cathedral
in this place and church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen 1150, which Robert
Warlewast, then Bishop of Exeter, opposed; and in his
first triennial visitation of the Cornish Diocese from Lanwhitton,
came and visited this collegiate church, and suppressed
the order of secular priests conversing at large in
the world, not tied to monastic life, and in the room of
them brought in black monks or canons Augustine (see <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Anthony,) and converted this church and college into an
abbey or priory of monks, by the name of the abbey or
priory of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s, whose governor was indifferently
called the abbat and prior of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s and Launceston.</p>

<p>And to this purpose we read in the first inquisition into
the value of Cornish Benefices before-mentioned 1294,
<!--463.png--><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457"></a><span class="pageno">457</span>

<abbr title="eight">viii</abbr><span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> Those monks before that
inquisition, out of a covetous desire after wealth and riches,
which they had obtained by gift or purchase, had wholly
impropriated and turned into small vicarages the revenues
of all such churches as to their abbey were annexed, and of
which they were patrons.</p>

<p>None of which churches’ revenues, because wholly impropriated
before the first inquisition, are rated or named
in the Pope’s or King’s Books of First Fruits to this day.
This parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s was rated to the four shillings
per pound Land Tax 1696, £174. 18<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span></p>

<p>In this parish are kept annually three fairs or public
marts, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> the 1st May, the 20th of July, and the 14th of

<p>The history relating to the more ancient ecclesiastical
establishments in this parish does not seem to be very clear
or distinct, although the general facts are well ascertained,
and accord with the prevailing spirit of the times in
which they occurred.</p>

<p>William Warlewast, who held the see of Exeter about
twenty years in the beginning of the twelfth century, suppressed
<!--464.png--><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458"></a><span class="pageno">458</span>
a college of secular priests attached to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s
Church, and founded a monastery of regular monks
near the place where <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas’s Church now stands.
This house he endowed with the lands of the former college,
and dedicated it to the same saint. It was constituted
a priory of the order of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austin, and remained till
the general dissolution.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons treats of the three parishes together, as
Launceston and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas were originally portions of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Stephen’s; and there is scarcely a doubt but that the
Cornish having by some accident adopted the Greek name
of the Protomartyr, called the church of Dunheved, Lan-Stephanon,
or Stephen’s Church, which easily glided into
Lanston, written Launceston; but in this, as in a thousand
other instances, the common pronunciation approaches
nearer to the true origin of a name, than the established
orthography, as Excester much more corresponds with a
camp on the Ex than Exeter.</p>

<p>In <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s and in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas’s, the parishioners
nominate the perpetual curates; and the latter parish is
tithe free.</p>

<p>The church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen, although it cannot reach
back nearly to the time of the college suppressed by
Bishop Warlewast, is yet on a scale superior to most others;
and seated on an eminence with a lofty tower, it presents an
object worthy of associating with the superb keep of Launceston
Castle.</p>

<p>There is an inscription within the Church, recording the
munificence of Charles Cheney, Lord Viscount Newhaven,
then Member for Newport, in re-building a part of the
fabric, and probably in repairing the remainder according
to the ill taste prevalent about the early part of the
eighteenth century, so as to make the interior of the
Church quite at variance with its exterior Gothic.</p>

<p>The late Sir Jonathan Phillips inhabited a good house
adjoining the street, which, with the attached property,
has since been united to the great political influence of the
place.</p>

<p><!--465.png--><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459"></a><span class="pageno">459</span>
The barton of Carnedon, an ancient possession of the
Blighes, and afterwards of the Cloberrys, is now the property
of Thomas Bewes, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>; and the barton of Tredidon,
formerly a seat of a family bearing the same name, is
now the residence of George-Francis-Collins Browne, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
who assumed the latter name on succeeding to the property
of his maternal grandfather, Mr. George Brown, of
Bodmin.</p>

<p>The modern history of this parish chiefly relates to the
borough of Newport, and to its connection with the adjacent
parish and seat of Werrington.</p>

<p>Newport is little more than a street of Launceston, extending,
with some interruption, to the northward. Its
political importance must have grown out of the religious
establishments.</p>

<p>Various accounts are given by Browne Willis and others
respecting the ancient constitution of this borough; but it
had practically arrived at the state of a burgage tenure;
and two officers elected by a homage in the Lord’s Court
presided over the elections. They were denominated vianders;
but no such word occurs in any usual books of reference.</p>

<p>Werrington appears to have belonged entirely to the
Abbey of Tavistock. At the time of the dissolution the
manor paid £141. 17<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 11<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> And under another head
is this entry: Worrington&mdash;Pensio de Ecclesia Sancti
Martini £2. 10<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span></p>

<p>The barton is known to have been one of the country
residences appropriated to the Lord Abbat, to whom the
mitre was granted by a papal bull in the reign of Henry
the Sixth, and on whom King Henry the Eighth, in consideration
of the especial devotion which he bore towards
the Blessed Virgin Mary, mother of Christ, and to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Rumon, bestowed the privileges of a spiritual lord of
Parliament in the fifth year of his reign.</p>

<p>At Werrington the Lord Abbat had a deer park, which
still remains in existence, his piscatories, and all the
appendages suited to a feudal baron.</p>

<p><!--466.png--><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460"></a><span class="pageno">460</span>
This property, together with all the other possessions of
the monastery, passed by a grant from King Henry the
Eighth, in the 31st year of his reign, to the family of Russel,
with whom a considerable part of this immense largess
still remains; but Werrington was sold to a successor of
the renowned circumnavigator Sir Francis Drake, who
parted with it to Sir William Morris. This gentleman
was the son of a clergyman from Wales, who had obtained
a Canonry of Exeter; and he rose in station and in fortune
by an early and close intimacy with General Monk,
when that military adventurer sacrificed not only his political
associates, but the liberties of his country, even to the
Petition of Rights, for the purpose of assuring his own
aggrandisement, a misconduct which entailed on the nation
all the doubtful and vacillating struggles in the reign of
Charles the Second, and demanded for its final remedy the
glorious Revolution of 1688. Werrington continued in
Sir William Morris’s family till the year 1775, when it
was sold to Sir Hugh Smithson, created Duke of Northumberland
in consequence of his marriage with Elizabeth
only daughter of Charles Seymour, Duke of Somerset, and
of Elizabeth, sole daughter and heir of Josceline Percy,
Earl of Northumberland. The Duke of Northumberland
wishing to pursue the path of ambition which then lay
open to any man of wealth, acquired with Werrington the
commanding property at Newport and the influence at
Launceston, and having made a similar acquisition lower
down on the banks of the Tamar, he had the satisfaction
of attaining the objects kept steadily in his view.</p>

<p>Although the parish of Werrington is completely in
Devonshire, and is believed to have formed a part of the
original endowment of Tavistock Abbey by Ordgar Earl
of Devonshire about the year 960; yet in spiritual matters
it forms a part of the Archdeaconry of Cornwall. At the
last census this parish contained sixty-six inhabitants; and
the annual value of the Real Property was returned in
1815 at £2809.</p>

<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s, with its little town of Newport, are obviously
too near Launceston to allow of their possessing
any separate market. Three fairs are, however, holden, as
is not unusual in the suburbs of most towns.</p>

<p>As so few persons attain the age of a hundred years, it
may be worth remarking, that the Editor remembers, about
fifty years ago, an aged person called Sarah <a name="err_14" id="err_14"></a>Coat, in the
service of Sir Jonathan Phillips’s family. She lived to
1814, and completed her hundred and fourth year.</p>

<p>In this parish stands the castle, honour, and manor of
Trematon.</p>

<p>This lordship was the King or Earl of Cornwall’s manor
of land beyond the records of time, and in particular, after
Cornwall was dismembered from Devon by King Athelstan,
Anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 930, of Ailmer, or Athellmaur or Athellmer,
i. e. muac, great, or noble, for so the Monasticon Anglicanum,
Anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 980, in <abbr title="tome">tom.</abbr> 1, page 258, calls him,
afterwards of Algar Earl of Cornwall, Anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 1046.
(Monasticon, page 1022) Then of Condura, or Condorus
in Latin, who was Earl of Cornwall, when William Duke
of Normandy invaded this land 1066, who as some say
submitted to his jurisdiction, by paying him homage for his
earldom, and swearing fealty to him; which history seems
not very concordant with reason or truth; since in the
second year of the Conqueror’s reign he was by him
deprived of this dignity, who gave the same to Robert
Guelam, Earl of Morton in Normandy, brother to King
William by his mother Arlotte, who had issue William
Earl of Morton and Cornwall, that entered into treasonable
practises on behalf of Robert Duke of Normandy,
against William Rufus and Henry <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> and so lost both those
earldoms, and died about the year 1035. After whose
death in all probability, Caddock, though some call him
Condorus <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> son of Condura, was restored to the earldom
<!--469.png--><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463"></a><span class="pageno">463</span>
of Cornwall, and lived and died in this place, whose only
daughter and heir Agnes, or Beatrix as others call her, was
married to Reginald Fitz Harry, base son of King Henry
First, by his concubine Anne, daughter of Robert Corbet
of Allencester, in the county of Warwick, who was in her
right created Earl of Cornwall by King Stephen, in the
5th year of his reign 1140.</p>

<p>Shillingham, in this parish, after the English, is a dwelling
covered with slatestones; after the Saxon, it is a corruption
of sylenhan, i. e. the paying, selling, or giving house,
home, or dwelling; after the British, Sillan or Cillanham,
i. e. the chapel house or dwelling; which gave name and
original to an old family of gentlemen, from thence surnamed
de Shillingham; whose heir, as I am informed, in
the beginning of Queen Elizabeth’s reign, was married to
Francis Buller, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> a younger branch of the Bullers of
[Lillesdon in Somersetshire]; he was Sheriff of Cornwall
42 Elizabeth, who had issue Richard Buller, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> Sheriff of
Cornwall 9 James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> who had issue Richard Buller, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>
afterwards knighted, Sheriff of Cornwall 12 Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
1637, who had issue Francis Buller, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> that married the
sole inheritrix of Ezekiel Gross of Golden, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> Attorney
at Law; by whom he had issue John Buller, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> who married
&mdash;&mdash; and had issue &mdash;&mdash;, that
died without issue; whereupon, John Buller of Morval,
<abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> that married Coode, second son of Sir Richard Buller
aforesaid, succeeded to this estate, and is now in possession
thereof; who had issue as is set forth in Morval parish.</p>

<p>Lastly, let it not be forgotten, that Francis Buller, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>
that married Gross aforesaid, entertained for his chaplain
one Mr. D. Eaton, a priest that officiated Divine Service
in his house, after the manner of the Church of England,
tempore Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> and was so kind and respectful towards
this doctor, that he made him his companion and amicus,
and reposed more confidence in his integrity than he had
reason to do; for this fellow, upon some discontent, went
from Mr. Buller, and made oath before some justice of the
<!--470.png--><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464"></a><span class="pageno">464</span>
Peace, or preferred an accusation of treasonable words in
the Crown Office, spoken by Mr. Buller at his table against
King Charles the Second’s Government, at such time as he
was his domestic chaplain.</p>

<p>Whereupon, Mr. Buller was taken into custody, and
examined before the King and Council, and thereupon
committed prisoner to the Tower of London; at length
indicted and tried at the King’s Bench Bar at Westminster,
upon this information of Eaton’s, and found guilty of misprision
of treason by the Grand and Petty Jurors; and
accordingly was sentenced by the Judges to pay to the
King a fine of thirty thousand pounds, and to remain a
prisoner during the King’s pleasure. Now, in order to
raise this money, it occasioned the selling of the manor and
lordship of Fentongollan, (See <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael Penkivell)
though much dismembered before, to the value of five
thousand pounds, by its former proprietors, John Hals and
Carmenow, out of which the manor of Tregothnan was
made, to Hugh Boscawen, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr></p>

<p>The articles of which bargain so distasted John Buller,
<abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> son of the said Francis, that to obstruct the sale of
that lordship, which was his mother’s lands, he forsook
this kingdom, and went into France, where he remained
for three years’ space, saying, he would rather sell Shillingham
and Golden than Fentongallan (for at that time was
extant upon it a spacious dwelling house, a tower of three
or four stories high, and a consecrated free chapel), which
had been the seat of several famous families.</p>

<p>But alas! let man pretend or intend what he will, fate or
destiny is unavoidable; for by reason of his father’s circumstances,
and to comply with his desire, at length he returned
into England, and then was concluded with his father in a
deed of sale of the premises by lease and release, for about
the consideration of seven thousand pounds, to Hugh Boscawen,
<abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> and executed the same, in presence of the
writer of these lines, at Mowpass Passage, about the year
1676, and soon after levied a fine for cognizance de droit to
<!--471.png--><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465"></a><span class="pageno">465</span>
dock the entail, and bar his heirs for ever. Afterwards,
his father Mr. Buller, to raise the remainder of his said fine
to the King, sold much other lands to make up the first
payment thereof, and was forced to settle all his other
estates in the hands of trustees, for raising the remainder,
confining himself to an annuity of £180 during his life.
Whereupon, having his liberty granted him by King
Charles, he removed into Oxfordshire; where, through
trouble of mind, arising from this sad accident by a malicious
and perfidious priest, he grew delirious, or in a
phrenzy, and died about the year 1679.</p>

<p>Earth, in this parish, gave name and original to an old
family of gentlemen, from thence surnamed de Earth, in
which place Galfridus de Earth held by the tenure of knight
service a knight’s fee of land, 3 Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> (Carew’s Survey
of Cornwall, page 41.) From the heirs of which Geffrey, by

likewise in Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>’s hands, this being in the <abbr title="third">3d</abbr> of
his reign; of which see what hath been said in Leskeard;
and from its being called in Domesday Book Tremeton,
and by Mr. Carew sometimes (ibid. <abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 41.) Tremerton,
I guess that the original name was Tremerton, the
great dwelling on the hill.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The church and tower of this parish, rival in their position
and in their general appearance those of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s
near Launceston. Within the church are several monuments
to the Bullers and other ancient inhabitants. Among
them is one to Jane, the wife of William Bond of Earth,
<abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> who died in the year 1640. But the great curiosity of
this parish is Trematon Castle, one of the fortified residences
of the Earls of Cornwall, while they exercised feudal
sovereignty within their dominions.</p>

<p>Mr. Hals and Mr. Tonkin have given histories rather of
the earls and of their adventures, than of the castle itself
<!--473.png--><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467"></a><span class="pageno">467</span>
and descriptions of its present appearance may be found in
all the various writers on Cornwall: these have therefore
been omitted.</p>

<p>Mr. Edward King in his celebrated work, Munimenta
Antiqua, or Observations on Antient Castles, <abbr title="volume three">vol. <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></abbr>
after ascribing the most remote antiquity to Launceston
Castle, which, for various reasons, he carries back beyond
the Roman Invasion, especially indicates various points of
distinction between the general construction of that fortress,
and those of the Saxons and Normans. He then says,</p>

<p>“Trematon Castle, in the very same county of Cornwall,
which may with good reason be concluded to have been
built by Robert Earl of Moreton, is a true Norman structure.
And there cannot be a greater contrast than there
is between it and Launceston. Like Tunbridge Castle, it
is placed, not on a high natural rock, but on an artificial
mount, and is no less than sixty feet in diameter on the
inside.” See the views of it in Borlase’s Antiquities, Second
Edition, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 354, Plate 31, and in Grose’s Supplement to his
Antiquities.</p>

<p>There does not appear to be any real military history
connected with this fortress. It proved an insecure place
of refuge during the insurrection of 1549, raised by Humphry
Arundell and others in favour of the old religion.</p>

<p>The castle was for some time occupied as subfeudatories
by the Barons de Valletorta, so called, it is said, from the
narrow winding valley, which descends from the castle wall
towards the south.</p>

<p>Roger de Valletort, Reginald, Ralph, Reginald, and
Roger, appear to have possessed or occupied Trematon from
about the year 1180, through nearly the whole of the next
century.</p>

<p>This fine ruin has within a few years received a most
material injury, at least in the opinion of all antiquaries,
by the building of a modern house in its Basse Court.</p>

<p>Although the castle is fallen into decay, the privileges of
the honor and manor to which this residence gave its name,
<!--474.png--><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468"></a><span class="pageno">468</span>
still continue in full vigour, possessing as royalties the whole
river Tamar, from some point above the castle to Plymouth
Sound, with the coast below high-water mark on such
parts of the opposite shore as are not held against them by
immemorial usage, which makes it the more strange that
Voltersholm (new-named Mount Edgecumbe by the first
gentleman of that family who acquired it) should be politically
considered as in Devonshire.</p>

<p>Not far from Trematon Castle, and evidently an appendage
to it, is situated the Town of Saltash.</p>

<p>After the entire change of manners and habits, of political
institutions and of property, which have taken place since
the feudal times, it is difficult now to conjecture why all the
villages adjacent to baronial castles were favoured with
municipal bodies and with corporate rights; institutions
quite hostile to the gloomy and solitary grandeur of the
chiefs by whom these privileges were bestowed. Perhaps
they were found indispensable for the protection of persons
necessary, in the rudest times, for the supply of articles of
commerce, of manufacture, and even of subsistence, against
the violence of retainers, who in those days supplied the
want of a more regular force, always required in some shape
or manner for the support of authority, and for the maintenance
of civilized society.</p>

<p>Saltash, under the name of Esse, received its first charter
of incorporation, as it appears on the authority of Doctor
Robert Brady, from a source which seems in modern times
wholly inadequate to bestow the gift, since the offices of
Duke, Earl, and Baron have long ceased to exist in England,
and these appellations, the shadows of a shade of times
past by, are only known as matters of mere compliment
given to the private gentlemen who now sit and vote in the
Upper House of Parliament, by virtue of Letters Patent
from the King. But when this charter was bestowed, the
Baron de Valletorta, although the vassal of a vassal of the
King of England, was yet a Prince within his small domain.</p>

<p>This charter, confirmed by the Earl of Cornwall, and
<!--475.png--><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469"></a><span class="pageno">469</span>
others substantiated by the supreme chief, raised into a
borough town sending members to Parliament, with a
mayor, alderman, and common council, a long narrow
street, descending to the river at such an inclination as to
make it quite inaccessible to a loaded carriage.</p>

<p>Modern improvements have however reached the Ville
de Esse; a good road is made round the south side of the
town, and a large vessel denominated a floating bridge,
propelled by steam acting on wheels connected with two
strong chains extended across the bottom of the river, conveys
passengers and carriages at all times, and independently
of the tide, and even of the strongest winds, to the
Devonshire side, where a road is now forming along the
banks of the Tamar, with causeways, so as to convert
a communication with Plymouth over three or four hills,
into nearly a complete level way.</p>

<p>The borough, which, in consequence of recent decisions
of the House of Commons, had become one of close nomination,
has disappeared in the great change of 1832.</p>

<p>Of the principal seats in the parish, Shillingham continues
to be the nominal residence of Mr. James Wentworth
Buller of Downs.</p>

<p>Earth, the ancient seat of the Bonds, has passed through
the Cornocks of Treworgy, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clear, to the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Lewis
Marshall. The family of Bond is represented at present
by Mr. Bond of Looe, and by the Bonds of Dorsetshire,
who shared the patronage of Corfe Castle with Mr. Bankes,
and of whom the late Mr. Nathaniel Bond was a member
of the Privy Council.</p>

<p>Ince Castle has-been purchased by Mr. Alexander Baring.
The house is situated almost on an island in the river,
and in the semblance of a fortress is flanked by a tower at
each of the four angles, which have probably given rise to
a tale of their having been constructed for a purpose in
strict conformity with the Mahometan Law, but most happily
at complete variance from our own.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head">Transcriber’s Note:</h3>

<p>This book was written in a period when many words and names had not
become standardized in their spelling. Words may have multiple
spelling variations or inconsistent hyphenation in the text. These
have been left unchanged. Dialect, obsolete and alternative spellings
were left unchanged, as were misspelled words in English, Old English
and Latin, incorrect use of homonyms, and sentences without verbs. The
book used hyphens, dots, and spaces of various lengths to indicate
unknown names, dates or words. For consistency, these were changed to
long dashes: &mdash;&mdash;. Insular letters were replaced with
contemporary equivalents.</p>

<p>Obvious printing errors, such as letters in the wrong order,
backwards, upside down, missing or partially printed, were corrected.
Unprinted punctuation and final stops missing at the end of
abbreviations and sentences were added. Duplicated words were removed.
Duplicate letters after rejoining words that were hyphenated at the
end of a line were removed, as were excess spaces in abbreviations of
titles, D.D. and M.D.</p>

<p>Footnotes were numbered in order and moved to the end of the
chapter in which the related anchors occur. A footnote anchor in
The “Manor of Sheviock” was deleted after the text, “for this
manor was at this time his inheritance,” as there is no footnote
in the chapter.</p>

<p class="p2">Noted, not changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the table for Maddern, the sum of value of Real Property and the
sum of 1801 population do not add to the totals provided.</li>

<li>Occasionally, the abbreviations for shillings or pence were omitted
from the text.</li>

<li>There are two pages numbered 48 and 49. The second of each is noted
as 48a and 49a.</li>

<li>In the valuation of property for <a href="#Sanctus">Sanctus Neotus</a>, the ‘b’ in
ib<sup>m</sup> and the ‘h’ in Johs have a tilde through the up-stem;
the stand alone ‘p’ and the one in psnal have a tilde through the
down-stem; the ‘p’ in pdial’ has a tilde above the letter. Standard
letters were substituted.</li>
</ul>
<p>The book contains the following pen and ink changes made by an unknown
hand. The changes were not made to the text, but are indicated below
in parentheses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>… mentioned under <a href="#chg_1"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ewan</a> (Erme) …</li>
  <li>… <a href="#chg_2">Marperian</a> (Marpesian) rock …</li>
  <li>… to <a href="#chg_3">distress</a> (disturb) a dying man …</li>
  <li>… under the assumed name <a href="#chg_4">&mdash;&mdash;</a> (of Peter) Pindar.…</li>
  <li>… the <a href="#chg_5">son</a> (in law) of his sister,…</li>
  <li>… viro inter hæc <a href="#chg_6">menia</a> (mœnia) semper memorando …</li>
  <li>… probably to St. <a href="#chg_7">Enny</a> (Euny) …</li>
  <li>… this <a href="#chg_8">house</a> (name) may indicate …</li>
  <li>… The late vicar Mr. <a href="#chg_9">Sechell</a> (Scotell) …</li>
</ul>

<p class="p2">The following were changed:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Column headers were added to table for Sancreed.</li>
 <li>Greek word κελιδον was changed to <a href="#chg_10">χελιδων</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The list of errata at the end of the book appears only in Volume 1,
and the Index appears only in Volume 4. Both were added for the
convenience of readers. Links are provided only to items
in this volume.</p>

<p>Starting on <a href="#Page_409">page 409</a>, there is a
46-paragraph quotation from the ninth century “Four Gospels in the
Vulgate Version.” The Old English characters were converted to
contemporary letters. Images of the original pages are displayed
